TEXT: The Threatening secession.;;; affairs in South Carolina --Acceptance of Senator Chesnut 's resignation — the Southern Press. &amp;c., &amp;c.;;; The feeling in South Carolina for secession seems steadily to advance.;;; In the legislative debates the only difference in the views of members is about the rapidity with which the act shall be consummated.;;; The resigned Federal officers of Charleston were in Columbia Saturday, and being serenaded made speeches of the same tenor of those delivered by them a few nights since, in the former city.;;; On Saturday evening, at the town of Mount Pleasant, S. C., some while boys, aided by negroes, were burning "Old Abe" in effigy, when they were fired on, and one of them shot by Jno. M. Barre, who was afterwards arrested by the citizens, and after receiving forty lashes, was placed in jail.;;; Bishop Davis, of the Diocese of South Carolina, has set forth a prayer, which is " to be used before the two final prayers of morning and evening service, on all occasions during the ensuing session or sessions of our Legislature." In the South Carolina Legislature, Saturday, the following took place@§@;;; Mr. Whaley said he held in his hand a resolution which he was certain would meet a cordial response from every member of this assembly.;;; It was as follows@§@;;; Resolved, That the resignation of the Hon. Jas. Chesnut as one of the U. S. Senators from South Carolina be accepted; and that what, under any other circumstances, would have been regarded with regret, is now recognized as an act of loyalty to the State of South Carolina.;;; Unanimously adopted, and sent to the Senate for concurrence.;;; Mr. Cunningham moved to proceed to the general orders with a view to take up a bill to arm the State.;;; He thought it important that the bill should get a reading in the Senate today if they wished to facilitate the business before the House.;;; At the request of Mr. Aldrich, the motion was withdrawn to permit a report to be made from the Committee on Federal Relations.;;; Mr. Aldrich then presented the report.;;; The report recommends an amendment to the Senate bill for the call of a Convention, naming the 6th day of December as the time for the election of delegates, instead of the 6th of January, and the 17th December as the time for meeting, instead of the 10th of January, as named in the Senate bill.;;; Mr. W. C. Black said he was exceedingly sorry to oppose the amendment.;;; He was perfectly willing to vote for the Convention, to go with the State, and, when she goes, to go as far as the farthest.;;; But he could not agree to the amendment proposed by the House Committee to the Senate bill, and hoped the House would not accept the amendment.;;; It was absolutely necessary that those who represented large districts, the people of which were not so thoroughly posted up as to the events transpiring around them, that they should have time to canvass those districts, and bring the people up to the point.;;; If they shortened the time they would have no opportunity to do that, and the consequences might be that those people would occupy a false position.;;; It was essentially necessary to the district he represented, that the amendment should not prevail.;;; He was exceedingly anxious, therefore, that the time should not be changed.;;; If they were precipitate, they might depend upon it, his district would not sustain the action of the House.;;; He, therefore, moved that the question be taken up by ayes and nays.;;; The bill was laid on the table to make way for the order of the day.;;; A Declaration of Independence.;;; The Washington Constitution publishes a declaration of independence, which is to be submitted at the coming South Carolina Convention.;;; The first sentence of the National Declaration is thus altered@§@;;; "We hold these truths to be self-evident@§@ that although all men are created wholly unequal, mentally, morally, and physically, yet they are all equally entitled, under every civilized government, to the full protection of their lives, persons, and property, for which protection governments are solely instituted among men, deriving their just powers solely from the consent of the governed.";;; The grievances cited, are@§@ 1st.;;; The war in the North against Southern institutions.;;; 2d.;;; The nullification of the fugitive slave law.-- 3d.;;; Upholding protection from slavery in the Territories. 4th.;;; The imposition of heavy taxes--"not simply without but directly against our representation, and our consent in the general Congress, by levying onerous and excessive duties upon goods imported in return for, and purchased by, our cotton, rice, and tobacco, in order to protect and encourage their own manufactures, and in order to expend vast sums at the North in improving and fortifying their own barbers, towns, and cities, at the evident and direct expense of the products and labor of the South." 5th.;;; The election of a President whose creed is the "irrepressible conflict.";;; The declaration concludes as follows@§@;;; We therefore, the representatives of the people of the State of South Carolina in convention assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of this State, solemnly publish and declare that the State of South Carolina is, and of right ought to be, a free and independent State; and that all political connection between it and the Northern States is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that as a free and independent State we have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and things which an independent State may of right do. And, for the support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.

O. Picayune opposes disunion.;;; It says@§@;;; Those who to-day refuse to make the victory lost a cause of revolution would be the first to resent and resist an open, undisguised violation of the rights reserved to the States.-- They are not less true to the South because also true to the Union.;;; They do not less see danger because they are determined to meet it in the Union.;;; And it is because of their devotion, both to the State and to the Federal Government, that they will not make an issue which cannot unite the people of the States who will all be imperiled by it, in every material and social interest.;;; A Southern Confederacy cannot be formed by States while in the Union.;;; It is forbidden by the Constitution, as is any association of States for any such purpose.;;; The secession of one State without concert with others is a species of dictation to its co-equals of the South.;;; Difficulties of every character surround the subject, and it requires deliberate preparation before a single step be taken.;;; In the meantime we shall see what necessity may exist for action.;;; We can judge whether this Government has proved a failure, and all hope of freedom is lost.;;; Such we believe will be the decision of the people of the South, and we look for the excitements of feeling to give place to a sober, intelligent and deliberate purpose to take no hasty step, yet to be prepared for whatever the future may have in store.;;; The Alexandria ( Va.) Sentinel favors a Southern Convention.;;; It says@§@;;; Suppose the South were in such manner to unite in solemn league to stand by each other.;;; Suppose they then united in a firm and temperate statement of their rights and their ultimatum of delay in having them recognized.;;; Suppose they demanded, by direct appeal to the fourteen Northern nullifying States.;;; the prompt repeal of their injurious laws, and the discharge of their covenanted duty.;;; Suppose, in case of refusal by any of these, they then appeal to the separate or collective authority of the several States, to exercise the converse right of secession --we mean the power of exclusion.;;; Suppose such exclusion from the Union be demanded against States that refuse to perform their obligations; that thus the guilty, not the innocent, may suffer.;;; Would these things, or would any other expedient, present any hope?;;; If so, let us try them.;;; And let no time be lost, for there is no time to lose.;;; Let no man delude himself with the idea that the Union will stand in the present position of issues and the present rapid working of things.;;; It is simply an impossibility; and he who would save it, should go rationally and instantly to work.;;; Delay is disunion, swift and sure.;;; A dispatch from Montgomery, Ala., dated the 11th inst., says@§@;;; A mass-meeting of the citizens of this city was held here last night.;;; All parties were represented.;;; The merchants, bankers, planters and politicians, are all decided in favor of a dissolution of the Union.;;; Gov. Moore, Mr. Yancey, and other prominent public men from all parts of the State, were present and made speeches in favor of disunion.;;; The Governor has decided to have the Convention meet on the first Monday in January.;;; The people desire it to be held sooner, but he does not feel authorized by the resolutions of the last Legislature to call the Convention until the electors have cast their votes for President in December.;;; On Wednesday he will publish a letter, stating the time on which he will issue his proclamation, and calling on the people to nominate candidates for the Convention.;;; It will be a strong disunion document.;;; There was much excitement at Winsboro', S. C., when Lincoln 's election was ascertained.;;; A dispatch dated the 7th, says@§@;;; The Minute Men have as much as they can do, for they are compelled to hold from two to three meetings a day to initiate members; the blue cockades are common here.;;; Guns, pistols and swords are in demand, and if the feeling manifested here is general throughout the State, South Carolina will soon be out of the Union, and a Black Republican President will never lord it over the old Palmetto State.;;; The Toronto (Canada) Leader says@§@;;; The returns indicate the election of Lincoln and Hamlin for President and Vice-President of the United States.;;; If this should turn out to be the case, some of the Southern States appear to be ready to make a move towards carrying out the threat to withdraw from the Union.;;; The Governor of South Carolina invited the Legislature to arm the State, but the latter had put the question off till it should be ascertained definitely whether Lincoln be really elected.;;; It is folly to talk about arming for the purpose of bringing about a dissolution of the Union; for if dissolution cannot be obtained without resorting to arms, it cannot with it. If it once comes to fighting it is all up with the South.;;; The North would crush her as easily as a giant crushes a fly. A Southern Convention there may be; but the supposed necessity for the South arming is the dream of a madman.;;; The action of the South will be watched with intense interest, for the great crisis in the history of the Republic has arrived.;;; It is for the interest of humanity that the great experiment of self-government, which the Republic is making, should succeed.;;; A dissolution of the Union would not necessarily prove the failure of that experiment, but it would be quoted as proof of failure by despots and reactionists in Europe.;;; It would be a melancholy thing to see a dissolution of the Union arising out of the struggle to extend slavery, and brought about by the aggressive party.;;; For these-reasons a dissolution of the Union is, under present circumstances, to be deprecated; but if it should come, we cannot afford to admit that it proves a failure of the great experiment which the United States are making.;;; There is too much that is bad in the governments of the world to justify any friend of freedom in going into raptures over the supposed failure of an experiment in self-government, such as, take it all in all, the world has never before seen.;;; We have no preference for Republicanism; the contrary; but it is so much better than most of the existing governments of the world, that we are not justified in depreciating the American system in the crisis of its fate.;;; [by Telegraph.] Louisville, Nov. 12.;;; --The brokers here are charging 5 per cent. discount on South Carolina and Georgia bank bills.

TEXT: Origin of consumption.;;; The American Medical Monthly for September contains some novel and interesting views relative to the nature and treatment of consumption.;;; The seat of this terrible malady is affirmed to be the lymphatic system of vessels; and of these minute tubes form a close interlacement throughout the whole body, being also endowed with much activity, diseased fluids transmitted through them are liable, under certain conditions, to be deposited anywhere, and to be spread or accumulated with prodigious rapidity.;;; The nature of consumption is stated to consist in a deprivation of the fluids which are propelled through these tiny lymphatic conduits.;;; Two theories are proposed to account for the presence of the pernicious elements which here taint and poison the springs of life at their source.;;; One party affirms that the process of nutrition is at fault, and that part of the food eaten is lazily and imperfectly assimilated, offering itself in a crude, half-prepared state, to the action of vessels not adapted to deal with such material, but only with that which has been submitted to a completer preliminary elaboration.;;; Hence cellular development, the first step in organization, is impossible.;;; The fluid cannot be taken up. It never becomes vitalized or forms a union with any living tissue.;;; On the contrary, it is a burden, and soon causes mischief.;;; Another party thinks that the material thus existing in the far-reaching network of lymphatic vessels is due to decay, and contains the products of organic dissolution.;;; Both opinions are well supported, and perhaps both may prove to be true.;;; That some noxious materials, whether the debris of used up tissues, or withered dead elements refusing to become new tissues, are thrown copiously near the lymphatic, is agreed; and also that the quantity of such products is so great that this active sewerage apparatus cannot carry it away.;;; It accumulates and hardens into tubercles.;;; The cause of this dreadful malady is stated by our author to be primarily the want of oxygen, whose presence in sufficient quantity would either prevent the formation of the tuberculous material, or would give power to cast it out as soon as formed.;;; A cure in the early stages of the disease is said to have sometimes been secured by the use of chlorate of potash, and other remedies which supply oxygen to the blood.;;; Prevention, however, here as everywhere, is easier than cure, and is seldom impossible, whatever be the hereditary tendency to the malady.--Muscular exercise, regular habits, fresh air, subtle food, ample rest, active occupation, well ventilated apartments, proper clothing, and exemption from corroding anxiety, are among the indispensable and most ordinary precautions.

TEXT: Republicanism in Europe.;;; The Zurich correspondent of the New York Journal of Commerce refers to the little impression made upon the public mind of Europe by Mazzini 's answer to the letter of Tumaleio, the new Dictator, In which he was requested voluntarily to leave the country.;;; In that address Mazzini says@§@;;; "I have made the greatest sacrifice which I ever could make, when out of love for freedom and concord I stopped the apostolate of my creed, and declared that I did acknowledge the monarchy, not from respect of ministers and monarchs, but for-the majority of the Italian people, ready to support it, if it would establish the unity of the country; and that, if once I should feel bound to raise against the old colors, I should publicly and candidly make it known to friends and foes, I cannot act otherwise.;;; If lawful men, like you, believe my words, it is your duty to convince my adversaries that the intolerance which they exercise is the only cause of anarchy which at present exists.;;; But if you do not believe a man, who for thirty years has been struggling with all his powers for the nation, who taught his accusers to stammer the word unity, and who never in his life spoke falsely, you may be as you please.;;; If men are ungrateful it is no reason why I should submit to their injustice, and moreover approve of it.";;; Nevertheless, Mazzini has left Naples, although he said he would not go, but it must be admitted that the party which he represents remains.;;; The Journal's correspondent gives to that party, under the leadership of Mazzini, all the credit of undermining the absolute monarchy and conspiring for its overthrow.;;; Without referring to more remote facts, he insists that the thorough revolutionising of the Two Sicilies and of the Papal States, the rising of the people in Sicily, in the Neapolitan provinces and in the Roman towns way, the expedition of Garibaldi and its great support with men, arms and money, as essentially and almost exclusively Republican work.;;; Garibaldi himself is a Republican at heart, as he recently affirmed anew when addressing in the city of Naples the officers of the National Guard in these words@§@;;; " Mazzini is a Republican, and I am a Republican, too. I declare this loudly, as I always have pronounced it before the world.;;; But Mazzini, one of the greatest spirits and the greatest hearts of Italy, accepts to-day, what I will@§@ The unity of the country with Victor Emanuel.;;; Mazzini does not stay here for the purpose of throwing obstacles in the way, but for furthering the national work.;;; He shall be respected like all other citizens; I will have it so. He has my word, my protection guards him.";;; We infer from the letter of the Journal's correspondent that this radical antipathy between the two factions in the Italian camp, will not be healed over by the armistice which they have concluded "on condition," says the writer, "that the monarchy should earnestly and sincerely promote the liberation and unification of the country. &amp;--It is still remembered that the Sardinian Government, though not daring to oppose Garibaldi 's expedition, publicly disavowed the General 's acts, and loudly protested that the armaments and expedition were undertaken without their knowledge and against their will; that they endeavored to confine Garibaldi to the island of Sicily, and to deprive him as soon as possible of his power; that they interfered by force with his expedition against Rome; that they stopped enlisting volunteers and collecting arms for him when they feared his power might become too great Count Cavour, according to recent revelations, even went so far as to call Garibaldi a crazy fool, when he started for Sicily.;;; But as soon as Garibaldi 's overthrow of the Neapolitan Government was an ascertained fact, the Sardinian Government took upon itself, with charming alacrity, the full responsibility of everything that was done; with singular modesty claimed the province for itself and the constitutional party, and with exquisite coolness denounced the real authors as agitators and disturbers of peace and order.;;; King Victor Emanuel, for instance, says in his proclamation to the people of Southern Italy@§@;;; "In the two Sicilies, the new order of things was instituted in my name; but some acts gave room to the apprehension that this policy, followed under my name, was not well interpreted; all Italy feared, that under protection of renowned popularity, of an antique honesty, a faction might gain strength, which would be able to sacrifice the triumph of nationality to the phantoms of their ambitious fanaticism.";;; The cause of Republicanism has suffered a heavy blow in Italy, and does not seem to have many friends in Europe.;;; The reason probably is, that Mazzini Republicanism means agrarianism, socialism, and universal anarchy.

HEADER: Northern Markets--[by Telegraph.]
TEXT: The New York Journal of Commerce, of Monday afternoon, says@§@;;; The money market continues very much unsettled, and it is difficult to effect negotiations upon any terms.;;; We hope for more case in a few days but confidence appears to be greatly shaken and it will be some time before there will be the same facilities for borrowing money that were enjoyed two or three weeks ago. It would appear that the demand for specie at the South has grown out of the prevalent agitations there, that have induced small capitalists to board the coin.;;; As long as this run continues the banks there must be short, and a suspension of specie payments almost a matter of necessity.;;; None of our readers need suppose that the monied institutions at the couth are doing anything to help on the agitation.;;; The suspension, if resolved on, will not be a political move, but an unavoidable measure of finance, authorized by the Legislatures, because to all appearances inevitable, whether thus sanctioned or not. Our banks here are doing their utmost to restore confidence, and accommodate the public.;;; The Ledger of Saturday says@§@;;; Confidence is gradually weakening, and its effects tell sensibly on prices.;;; The exciting reports from the South, published in the sensation papers, alarm the timid, and, if persisted in, may, by centering around some weak saving fund or bank, provoke a run, and by that run endanger all. The whole South is greatly exasperated, and evidently much disposed to take counsel from their feelings and passions.;;; Such being the case, it is the part of prudence that the North shall avoid all the irritating issues, and by forbearance and generosity endeavor to assure our brethren of the South that nothing prejudicial to their rights is contemplated or will be permitted.;;; This done, and the wrongs complained of may be forgotten in memory of the affection that has so long held us in family union.;;; The Philadelphia Pennsylvanian says@§@;;; The week closed on a feverish and excited Stock market, and the day's sales were very meagre.;;; The secession movement at the South is becoming exceedingly grave, and influences disastrously every department of business and trade.--The last week has witnessed the shipment of over three millions of specie to the South in consequence of the refusal of the Southern banks to purchase Northern and Liverpool acceptances; and we have too much reason to fear that this is only the beginning.;;; If the cotton growers have made up their minds to sell only for gold, and to hoard temporarily the result of their sales, a very serious drain of specie will be experienced, both here and in England, and commercial disaster must ensue.;;; The same feeling which demands gold will check Northern payments, and the proceeds of the crop will remain in the South, leaving the debt unpaid it was expected to meet.;;; The political agitation in the South has now a financial bearing of unusual significance, and is brought closely home to every man having a note to pay. If the Cotton movement is to be made upon the basis of gold in hand before it leaves the control of the factor and planter, debtors may make up their minds to a tight money market and the losses it will inflict.;;; New Orleans, Nov.9th. --The exchange market is almost at a stand.;;; Bills on London are in free supply, but there is no market for them except at very depressed rates.;;; Sight bills on the North are selling at 1 ¼ per cent.;;; discount, while in time bills there is scarcely any disposition to operate.;;; The money market is still very unsettled, and all parties are anxious for a speedy let-up of existing troubles.;;; Sales in New York, Nov. 12th, of $13,000 Va. 6 's at 86½; $15,000 do. at 87; $4,000 do. at 87, and $17,000 N. C. 6 's at 93.;;; Northern Markets-- [by Telegraph.];;; Baltimore, Nov. 13. --Flour has declined 5 to 10 cents; Wheat 1 to 2; Corn has a downward tendency, and 1 cent lower.;;; Provisions dull.;;; Whiskey dull at 21 cents.;;; New York, Nov. 13. --Cotton steady-- Orleans Middling 11½ Flour lower — Southern $5,60 @ 5.90.;;; Wheat 1 @ 2 cents lower — Southern White $1,50; Western $1,58.

HEADER: The Prince of Wales in New York.
TEXT: The Prince of Wales in New York.;;; The correspondent of the London Times was famously pleased with the reception of the Prince of ales in New York.;;; We extract a few paragraphs from his account, received by our last English mails@§@;;; There was no pomp or pageantry attempted of any kind, no grand liveries or gilded coaches.;;; There was a military procession, but that was only an item in the great feature of the day, which was the welcome of the people.;;; It was such a welcome as only a whole people and a free people could ever give, and in the details of its enthusiasm and its good order there was much, strange as it may seem, that made such a reception possible only in New York.;;; In Paris it would have been a governmental affair of soldiers and gendarmes; in London it would have been a mob with an immense police force to control it. Here it was simply the people turning out in hundreds of thousands.;;; A huge sea of decorous, but most enthusiastic spectators, who even at the spots where they were densest were yet so quiet, so impressive in their majesty of good order, that at no one place did they seem to have a single element in common with what we call a mob.;;; It seemed more a gigantic meeting of the citizens of New York, convened for some great and solemn rejoicing along the whole length of the city, than the mere chance mustering of its busy, restless, and excitable population.;;; It was such a grand display of popular enthusiasm, there was such a dignity in the calm reliance felt by every one in the preservation of order, such a perfect warmth and geniality of kindness evinced from highest to lowest towards the young visitor, as made the whole demonstration, perhaps, one of the most remarkable of its kind that has ever taken place.;;; Quiet and demure as are the English people, there are yet few Englishmen who can realize the fact of the whole inhabitants of an immense city turning out to witness a spectacle and give a cordial welcome, intrusted at the same time with the duty of keeping order among themselves.;;; Yet this was actually the case at New York; and along three miles of road, thronged with half a million or more of spectators there were not fifty policemen, and even these were only stationed at intersecting streets to stop carts and vehicles from entering the line of the route.;;; Yet description does not easily convey the idea of such a multitude — the strict, the rigid good order and good humor that prevailed.;;; This, too, was not for an hour, or only while the Prince was passing.;;; It was the unvarying demeanor of the whole concourse from ten in the day till past six at night.;;; The public of New York had been so schooled and abused by all their journals as to the necessity for a quiet, yet kindly welcome, that one would almost have thought, from the tone of the articles, that the populace of this great city were a mere horde of untutored miscreants, people to whom it was necessary to point out the most ordinary rules of civilized intercourse.;;; In fact, throughout the whole course of this tour, with few exceptions, the New York journals have never ceased to heap dirt upon the manners and customs of their own countrymen.;;; A little crowding at the country towns, the mere harmless curiosity of villagers, en route, has been transformed in the columns of certain newspapers into studied outrages, and visited, in the columns of the New York Herald particularly, with such a downpour of maudlin "Billingsgate," as if any sensible American ever minded how that journal raved, must have made the poor country people regret the hour they ever saw his Royal Highness at all.;;; A long, deep, tremendous, sustained cheer greeted the Prince, whose appearance astonished every one.;;; Slight and almost boyish in his appearance in morning dress, in uniform and on horseback he looks a young nobleman, of whom, apart from his exalted position, any Englishman might be proud to see acknowledged as a representative of his nation.;;; He sits a horse as only young Englishmen can, and receives his homage of welcome with the easy grace of one to the manor born.;;; Certainly, as he cantered down to the Battery, his horse rearing and prancing with timidity at the tumult of cheers around, he looked even worthy of the great welcome that awaited him, and more than this it would be difficult to say.--In the Battery were drawn up in successive lines five brigades of the New York militia --mustering in all some 6,000 or 7,000 men.--Taken as a type of the volunteers of this country, they certainly were splendid specimens.;;; In the 3d brigade were the 7th regiment, the pride and admiration of New York.;;; They are undoubtedly, a most perfect body of soldiers, equal in all the minute technicalities of discipline to our very best line regiments.;;; I must own, however, I cannot share in the feeling here which awards all praise to the 7th, and I cannot pay the militia of New York a higher compliment than to say that, to my unprejudiced eye, there were several other regiments there almost, if not quite, as good as the famous 7th.;;; The 4th Brigade, to use Lord John Russell 's simile, was "conspicuous for the absence of the 69th Regiment. Colonel Corcoran and his officers and men refused to turn out to welcome the Prince.;;; The inspection of the militia merely consisted of riding slowly along the front of each corps.;;; Every regiment drooped colors and presented arms as the Prince approached them surveying with open admiration the handsome uniforms, the erect, steady, military aspect of every company, regiment, and brigade on the ground.;;; As a volunteer militia, they certainly formed a body of men of whom any nation might feel proud.;;; Professional Cards.
