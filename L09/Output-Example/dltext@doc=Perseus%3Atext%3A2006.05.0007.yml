C. Gov. Gist has sent Gen. Gist on a mission of consultation to the Governors of the Southern States.;;; The resignation of the Federal officers of the port has been noticed.;;; On Wednesday the U. S. District Court assembled, and the Grand Jury being questioned as to whether it had presentments to make, replied as follows@§@;;; The verdict of the Northern section of the Confederacy, solemnly announced to the country through the ballot-box on yesterday, has swept away the last hope for the permanence, for the stability of the Federal Government of these sovereign States; and the public mind is constrained to lift itself above the consideration of details in the administration of Law and Justice, up to the vast and solemn issues which have been forced upon us. These issues involve the existence of the Government of which this Court is the organ and minister.-- In these extraordinary circumstances, the Grand Jury respectfully decline to proceed with their presentments.;;; They deem this explanation due to the Court and to themselves. " U.S. District Court Grand Jury";;; The Judge of the Court, Hon. A. G. Magrath, then rose in his seat and resigned his office, saying@§@;;; In the political history of the United States, an event has happened of ominous import to fifteen slaveholding States.;;; The State of which we are citizens has been always understood to have to have deliberately fixed its purpose whenever that event should happen.;;; Feeling an assurance of what will be the action of the State, I consider it my duty, without delay, to prepare to obey its wishes.;;; That preparation is made by the resignation of the office I have held.;;; For the last time I have, as a Judge of the United States, administered the laws of the United States, within the limits of the State of South Carolina.;;; While thus acting in obedience to a sense of duty, I cannot be indifferent to the emotions it must produce.;;; That department of Government which.;;; I believe, has best maintained its integrity and preserved its purity, has been suspended.;;; So far as I am concerned, the Temple of Justice, raised under the Constitution of the United States, is now closed.;;; If it shall be never again opened, I thank God that its doors have been closed before its altar has been desecrated with sacrifices to tyranny.;;; May I not say to you that, in the future which we are about to penetrate, next to the reliance we should place in the goodness of that God who will guide us in the right way, should be our confidence in our State, and our obedience to its laws.;;; We are about to sever our relations with others, because they have broken their covenant with us. Let us not break the covenant we have made with each other.;;; Let us not forget that what the laws of our State require, become our duties.;;; And that he who acts against the wish, or without the command of his State, usurps that sovereign authority which we must maintain inviolate.;;; The address was received with profound silence, and during its delivery many of the spectators were in tears.;;; Jas. Connor, the U. S. District Attorney, then made a brief address also resigning his office.;;; At night, a large crowd assembled and serenaded Judge Magrath, Mr. Connor, and the U. S. officers of the port who had resigned.;;; John Laurens, the naval officer of the port, in a card in the papers declines resigning at this time, believing that his duty to the city forbids it. A Columbia, S. C., Wednesday night, Edmund Ruffin, of Virginia, was serenaded at the Congress House, and addressed a large gathering.;;; A dispatch to the Courier says@§@;;; He said the question now before the country he had studied for years.;;; It had been the one great idea of his life.;;; The defence of the South, he verily believed, was only to be secured through the lead of South Carolina.;;; As old as he was, he had come here to join them in that lead.;;; He wished Virginia was as ready as South Carolina; but unfortunately she was not; but circumstances being different, it was perhaps better that Virginia and all other border States remain quiescent for a time, to serve as a guard against the North.--The first drop of blood spilled upon the soil of South Carolina, would bring Virginia and every Southern State with them.;;; By remaining in the Union for a time, she would not only prevent coercive legislation in Congress, but any attempt for our subjugation.;;; No argument in favor of resistance was wanted now. As soon as he had performed his duty in Virginia as a citizen, he came as fast as steam could bring him to South Carolina.;;; He was satisfied it anything was to be done, it was to be done here.;;; He had no doubt it would be done, and the sooner the better.;;; Every day delayed was a day lost to the cause.;;; They should encourage and sustain their friends, and they would frighten their enemies.;;; There was no fear of Carolina remaining alone.;;; She would soon be followed by other States.;;; Virginia and half a dozen more were just as good and strong, and able to repel the enemy as if they had the whole of the slaveholding States to act with them.;;; Even if Carolina remained alone-- not that he thought it probable, but supposing so — it was his conviction that she would be able to defend herself against any power brought against her. Multitudes spoke and said the issue was one of courage and honor, or of cowardice, desertion and degradation.;;; The following are the resolutions offered in the South Carolina House of Delegates, the consideration of which was commenced on Thursday@§@;;; Resolved, That the Committee on the Military of the Senate and House of Representatives, be instructed to meet during the recess, and to prepare a plan for arming the State and for organizing a permanent Military Bureau; and that the said committee be instructed to report by bill to their respective Houses on the first day of the re-assembling of the General Assembly.;;; Resolved, That the Committee of Ways and Means of the House of Representatives be instructed to sit during the recess and prepare a bill for raising supplies necessary to carry into effect the measure recommended by the Military Committee, and to report by bill on the first day of the re-assembling of the General Assembly.;;; Resolved, That the Governor be requested immediately to apply the one hundred thousand dollars appropriated by the last General Assembly, to the purchase of arms.;;; Resolved, That immediately after the election of the Commissioner to the State of Georgia, this General Assembly do take a recess until the third Monday, being the 19th of November, instant, at 7 o'clock.;;; Resolved, As the sense of this General Assembly, that the election of a Black Republican to the Presidency of the United States, will be the triumph and practical application of principles incompatible with the peace and safety of the Southern States.;;; Resolved, That a Commissioner be elected, by joint ballot of the Senate and House of Representatives, whose duty it shall be in the event of Mr. Lincoln 's election, to proceed immediately to Milledgeville, the seat of Government of the State of Georgia, whose Legislature will then be in session, to announce to the government of that State that South Carolina, in view of the impending danger, will immediately put herself in a state of efficient military defence and will cordially co-operate with the State of Georgia in measures for the protection of Southern interest, and to express the readiness of this State to co-operate with the State of Georgia in the event of Mr. Lincoln 's election in withdrawing at once from the Confederacy, and to recommend the calling of a Convention simultaneously in both States to carry this measure into effect, and to invite the co-operation of all the Southern States in withdrawing from the present Union, and forming a separate Southern Confederacy.;;; The resolution offered in the Senate provides for election of members to a Senate provides for election of members to a State Convention on the 22d instant --the Convention to meet on the 17th of December.;;; This body is to be continued by adjournments from time to time, as may be necessary, unless sooner dissolved by their own authority.;;; It shall cease and be discontinued in two years from the day on which it assembled.;;; The Charleston Mercury publishes the following suggestion for the flag of the " Southern Confederacy@§@";;; The ground entirely blue, with a golden Palmetto in the centre; a golden rattlesnake twining round the stem of the Palmetto, with its rattle sprung, head erect, and tongue protruded.;;; In the background, to the rear of the tree and snake, a golden spread eagle, and a single golden star in the upper right corner, with the words "Room for More" on the opposite.

TEXT: The Republican Press on the election.;;; The New York Times, with a semi-official tone, tells us what Mr. Lincoln will and what he will not do@§@;;; There can be no doubt whatever in the mind of any man that Mr. Lincoln regards slavery as a moral, social and political evil, and that it should be dealt with as such by the Federal Government, in every instance where it is called upon to deal with it at all. On this point there is no room for question — and there need be no misgivings as to his official action.;;; The whole influence of the Executive department of the Government, while in his hands, will be thrown against the extension of slavery into the new Territories of the Union, and the re-opening of the African slave trade.;;; On these points he will make no compromise nor yield one hair's depth to coercion from any quarter or in any shape.;;; He does not accede to the alleged decision of the Supreme Court that the Constitution places slaves upon the footing of other property, and protects them as such wherever its jurisdiction extends, nor will he be, in the least degree, governed or controlled by it in his executive action.;;; He will do all in his power, personally and officially, by the direct exercise of the powers of his office and the indirect influence inseparable from it, to arrest the tendency to make slavery national and perpetual, and to place it in precisely the same position which it held in the early days of the Republic, and in the view of the founders of the Government.;;; On this point, we take it for granted, he will be firm and immovable — so as to put it beyond the hope of any class or any section to change his purpose.;;; Upon all other points his speeches justify us in saying that he will be tolerant and considerate of the rights and interests of the Southern States to the utmost extent which any man can ask. He holds each State to be completely sovereign over its own affairs, and denounces any attempt on the part of the Federal Government to interfere with slavery in the Southern States as unconstitutional and unjust.;;; While he believes that Congress has the power to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, he is opposed to its exercise unless with the free assent of a majority of the inhabitants and with full compensation to the owners of the slaves.;;; He asserts the right of the South to a Fugitive Slave Law which shall be effective in its operation.;;; He declares his opposition to negro suffrage, and to everything looking towards placing negroes upon a footing of social and political equality with the whites; but he asserts for them a perfect equality of civil and personal rights under the Constitution.;;; He acknowledges the difficulties surrounding the question of slavery; frankly confesses that he sees no way of bringing it to a safe and speedy end; deprecates the agitation which has grown out of the attempt to extend it, to nationalize it and make it perpetual; and declares his belief that by the arrest and defeat of that attempt alone can this agitation be allayed.;;; The New York Courier closes its announcement of the result with these words@§@;;; Abraham Lincoln is elected, but in his administration the South will find all their rights respected, and will see all the clouds of misrepresentation which have obscured his real character, and that of the party whose standard he bears, roll away from the view.-- Stretching out our hands to the South over this victory, we have no word of taunt to utter for the threats of disunion which were raised for our defeat.;;; Let those threats be buried in oblivion, for through the long vista of this success we see a reign of peace from slavery agitation, established simply by that circumscribing of slavery within its local bounds, and that firm defence of the integrity of national freedom, which this triumph of the Republican party on the 6th of November; 1860, seals now and henceforth.;;; The New York Post in concluding an article on the present prospects of its party says@§@;;; Our success in the election, by deciding one question, the extension of slavery to the Territories, has deprived our party of one important bond of union, one of the most powerful causes which have attracted to it the interest and favor of the people.;;; Its place can only be supplied by an earnest endeavor to distinguish the Republican administration by an enlightened zeal for the public welfare.

November 5, 1860.;;; An ebullition of patriotism is pervading the whole country around here as the election draws nigh.;;; An instance of it may not be uninteresting to your readers.;;; On Friday last the students of the College were surprised at seeing a huge placard posted on the bulletin announcing that " Abe Lincoln " would be hung in effigy that evening, and, consequently, surmises were rife and anticipations of fun indulged in. Soon after sunset a line was formed at the College, and the effigy — a regular six -footer — was escorted to a gallows, which had been erected during the day, and which stood on a small knoll immediately in front of the College campus.;;; The doleful notes proceeding from a few musical instruments, accompanied by a huge bass drum, informed the inhabitants of the vicinity that the long-wished-for-event was about to take place.;;; The effigy was placed upon the gallows, and, at a signal, was hoisted to the gaze of all. Shout after shout rent the air, and after order was restored an eulogy upon the character of the deceased was pronounced by H. Lausing Burrows, a student from Richmond.;;; The effigy hung upon the gallows throughout that night, and all day Saturday, attracting the attention of all passers-by.;;; On Saturday night a line of students was again formed, and, accompanied by the music and pine torches, proceeded once more to the gallows, where, amid the renewed shouts of the people, it was burned.;;; The crowd, after three cheers for the Union, dispersed.;;; The whole event passed off without any disturbance, and was under the sanction of the entire Faculty.;;; The eulogy was pronounced to be as good a satire upon Lincoln as could be expected from so youthful an aspirant for oratory.;;; It abounded with several hits full of wit, and was received with much applause by all. The gallows still stands in remembrance of the patriotic deed. Corsair.

TEXT: Thankful for small favors.;;; The London Times is of opinion that the people of the United States ought to be very thankful to the British Government for taking General Walker off their hands and delivering him to the executioner.;;; We suppose, also, that the arrest and detention of United States naval officers lately in Central America should form another subject of national gratitude.--But there are people who never can be made to appreciate a kind action.;;; There are hard-hearted ingrates in the United States who, instead of overflowing with love and sensibility for these and many like favors, would actually rend and devour the hand that caresses and blesses us. We apprehend that if the people of the United States were a united people, and had the faintest conception of their own strength, England would be repaid in kind for every such favor as the Times boasts of, and repaid with compound interest.;;; It is because the Governments of Europe cannot understand American forbearance, that they constantly suspect us of acting on a similar policy of selfish aggrandizement to that which dictates their own counsels.;;; They know that we are powerful, and wonder that we do not use that power.;;; So far as England is, concerned, we can reconstruct the political equilibrium on this Continent, and make the Monroe doctrine something more than a figment, without any dread of her resentment.;;; She cannot afford to go to war with a nation whose products are the first elements of industry in all parts of the world, and whose commercial intercourse makes an important branch of industry for her Government.;;; Such a war would be a violent rupture of all the arteries of commercial circulation.;;; It would be a fatal separation between England which needs America and America which does not need England.;;; Take from England the cotton of the South and what becomes of her manufacturing and commercial prosperity?;;; However, knowing we have the power of doing as we choose, and that she cannot afford to resist it, we are constantly suspected of using that power improperly, and are closely watched by the European governments upon the principle of "set a rogue to catch a rogue.";;; Lately, however, we have developed elements of weakness, which encourage England to bestow upon us gratuitously such favors as those for which the Times calls upon us to be thankful.;;; To the machinations of her agents we are indebted, in no small measure, for the internal strife and discord which threaten our overthrow.;;; Who believes that if we were a united people, she would ever have employed her cruisers upon this coast in overhauling American vessels, or acted the part of a policeman generally in Central America ?;;; The Sampson of the West is shorn of his locks by his own folly, and he seems to be destined hereafter to make sport for the Philistines.

Whereas, upon the Late;;; visit of the Young Guard, of the city of Richmond, to the city of Baltimore, they were received by the Battalion of the Baltimore City Guard with all the warmth of soldierly hospitality, and everywhere met with numberless marks of attention and kindness@§@ Therefore be it;;; Resolved, That the most sincere thanks of this corps, and of the officers accompanying it, are fully due and are warmly returned to the City Guard Battalion for the courtesy, kindness and hospitality with which they welcomed us to the Monumental City; that to both officers and privates, and to the courteous guidance and gentlemanly bearing of the committees of the corps, appointed for our comfort and entertainment, do we owe most of the pleasure enjoyed upon a visit where nothing but pleasure greeted us; and that whenever the opportunity and privilege is allowed us, if we cannot equal, will yet strive to follow such a brilliant example of soldierly feeling and generosity.;;; Resolved, That this corps return their warm thanks to the officers and privates of the Law Grays for giving to the Young Guard another proof of their kindness and hospitable feeling, in the collation to which we were invited in such a genial spirit of welcome, and that when the wished for opportunity is afforded us to reciprocate it, we will let our "actions speak louder than words.";;; Resolved, That the praise of this corps is heartily given to the gentlemanly Proprietors and Assistants of the Gilmore House, whose consideration for our comfort, and untiring efforts to please and accommodate us, could not, we feel assured, have been equalled.;;; Resolved, That to the politeness and urbanity of Capt. James, Superintendent of the City Jail, we are indebted for a morning of much interest and instruction, in examining the institution of which he has charge, and that we return our sincere thanks to him and his family for the fine collation prepared for the comfort of the "inner man.";;; Resolved, That we return our thanks for the invitation kindly extended to us by the Executive Committee of the Maryland Institute, which in visiting we experienced much interest and pleasure.;;; Resolved, That we return our thanks to John T. Ford, Esq., for the kind invitation extended to the corps to visit his Theatre, the acceptance of which gave us an opportunity to see how well he caters to the public taste, and how well repaid is his "study to please.";;; Resolved, That we cannot but praise the manner in which the corps were treated upon the steamer George Peabody, by Capt. Pritchard and his assistants, whose wishes to increase our comfort and enjoyment were untiring, and we can truly say, fully successful.;;; Resolved, That the thanks of the corps are due and are hereby tendered Miss Burns, of Baltimore, for the beautiful wreath presented to the corps, which will ever be a souvenir to remind the members of the kind, patriotic, and beautiful ladies of that city.;;; Resolved, That these resolutions be published in the Baltimore papers and the Richmond Dispatch, and also be severally transmitted to Major Warner, of the City Guard Battalion; to Capt. Bowers, of the Law Grays; to Mr. Stone, of the Gilmore House; to Capt. James, Superintendent of the Baltimore City Jail; to John T. Ford, Esq.; Capt.

HEADER: A dark page from Russian History.
TEXT: A dark page from Russian History.;;; Few readers of Russian history will fail to remember the name of Count Alexey Orloff, one of the most prominent actors in the murder of Peter III, of Russia.;;; But treacherous as was that deed, it loses half its blackness when compared with another committed by him at the instigation of Catharine II., widow and successor to the murdered monarch.;;; Catharine, not being a native Russian princess, was most desirous of removing from her path all who might be supposed likely to disturb the security of her government; and in order to effect her purpose, in one instance, she and her associate Orloff exercised a degree of fiendish ingenuity almost unparalleled in history.;;; The unfortunate girl who excited the jealousy of Catharine was a Russian princess, and grand-daughter to Peter the Great.;;; Elizabeth II., his daughter, contracted a private marriage with Count Alexey Razumoffsky, and three children, two sons and a daughter, were the issue of this union.--Of the sons, it is only necessary to say that one was accidentally killed, and the other not judged of sufficient political importance to excite either jealousy or suspicion.;;; But it was otherwise with the young Princess Tarranakoff, the subject of our story.;;; The ambitious designs of the Empress Catharine with regard to Poland excited the indignation of the Polish nobles, and one of these, the Count Radzivill, conceived the design of using this young native princess as an instrument in supplanting her. For this purpose, by dint of bribing her female attendants, he secretly removed her to Poland, and thence to Italy.;;; Many attempts were made to induce Radzivill to place the young princess in the power of Catharine; but though reduced to poverty by the confiscation of his estates, the promise of their restoration, and the offer of the most costly bribes, failed in inducing him to yield.;;; No effect being produced by such proposals, the empress had recourse to threats.;;; Mysterious communications were conveyed to the Polish count, intimating that ruin and misery impended over the Princess Tarranagoff, which could be averted only by his ceasing all correspondence with her.--Whatever ambitious designs might have actuated Radzivill, he was most anxious for the safety of the unfortunate girl.;;; What could he do?;;; Shorn of his estates and dignities, and in a foreign land, how was he to protect her from a powerful empress and most unscrupulous woman!;;; Unhappily, he yielded to these covert menaces, and look a final leave of the princess, having first exacted a pledge from the Russian government that she should remain unmolested.;;; This separation effected, the most difficult part of Catharine 's work was completed, and by the aid of the Count Alexey Orloff, and one of his infamous associates, the rest became easy.;;; Though the murderer of her husband, Count Alexey retained the favor of his imperial mistress; doubtless, she found him a most useful tool in accomplishing other dark deeds, though a fouler crime than the one committed on this hapless princess could hardly disgrace human nature.;;; When first resident at Rome, the granddaughter of Peter the Great was amply supplied with everything befitting her rank; but at the time Orloff came thither, she was almost in want, and occupying a poor lodging in a humble quarter of the city.;;; Judge of her surprise when an elegantly attired officer called upon her to offer his services.;;; Though he was to all appearance wealthy, and her situation one of actual indigence, he paid her the same respect as though she had been seated on the imperial throne.--When invited to sit in her presence, he respectfully declined.;;; "Misfortune," said he, "cannot after your claims to our respect.;;; Can I, when you are before me, forget that the granddaughter of the illustrious Czar Peter the Great is entitled to all the homage I can offer!;;; Is it for me, because you are in a foreign land, to forget that to you, and not to the tyrannical foreigner who occupies it, belongs the imperial throne of Russia!;;; I have not the honor to be your country man, but believe me, princess, I am not the less devoted to your service, in which I would freely lay down my life.";;; The unfortunate princess listened with delight and thankfulness to this address.;;; It was long since such respectful language had greeted her ears, and the departure of Radzivill had almost reduced her to despair.;;; She answered this flattering speech in terms which proved how much pleasure it had given her, and desired to know to whom she was indebted for this solicitude respecting her welfare.;;; To this her visitor replied@§@ "That his name was of little moment, since he was only the ambassador sent by some of her most influential countrymen, whose hearts bled to think that she, the descendant of one so doubly illustrious as the Czar Peter the Great had proved himself to be, should be exposed to neglect and indigence in a foreign land." --The princess being naturally curious to know the names of those whose interest was so deeply excited in her behalf, again pressed her visitor for information on this point, but he still refused to gratify her curiosity.;;; He, however, begged permission to present one who would explain all; and having obtained it, withdrew as from the presence of a sovereign prince, having first knelt to kiss her hand.;;; The visitor who thus imposed on the credulity of the Princess Tarranakoff was indeed employed by one of her countrymen, he being the spy and associate of Count Alexey Orloff.;;; The uniform in which he appeared was of course assumed for the occasion, as he was in reality a man of most infamous character, a Neapolitan by birth, and chosen as his tool by the count, because he had already committed crimes sufficient to prove that he would enter unscrupulously into the designs of that nobleman.;;; Ribas, for that was his name, did not at once introduce Orloff to the presence of his intended victim; he repeated his visit, and finding that she was in actual need, induced her to make use of his purse, and by the respect he paid her, completely won her confidence.;;; Now was Orloff 's time.;;; When informed that the schemes of his emissary had proved successful, and the princess was duly prepared to listen to and believe whatever he might advance, the principal tragedian, as we may call him, appeared on the stage.;;; Better skilled in the ways of a count than was his emissary, the deference of the latter sank into insignificance when compared with that of his more polished employer; and so well did the latter play his part, that the princess became devotedly attached to the man whom she believed to be a model of all that was noble, good, and disinterested.;;; In a short time, Orloff had cause for exultation in the success of his plan, for the princess readily consented to be his wife.;;; A sham-marriage completed the deception, and was followed on the part of the princess by a brief period of unclouded happiness.;;; Never for a moment did she suspect the imposition that had been practised upon her, but built with the most perfect faith on the affection and sincerity of him she believed to be her husband.;;; One day he entered her presence with an air of the greatest concern, and on her inquiring the reason of his sadness, Orloff replied@§@ "Ah, dearest, I may well look sorrowful, since I must leave you — you whom all here call the good and the beautiful.;;; But who can tell how good or how beautiful you are in my eyes?;;; You, the granddaughter of one who made himself as illustrious by his deeds as by his high station, yet deigned to bestow on me the treasure of your love.";;; "Why speak of this, Alexey?" said the princess.;;; "My birth mattered little when you sought and found me poor-nay, in want.;;; It was not on an illustrious princess you fixed your affections, but on a neglected and unfortunate woman.;;; Why should we part?;;; Can I not accompany you!;;; Am I not your wife, and as such, is it not my pleasure to sacrifice my convenience to yours?";;; It was, of course, no part of Orloff 's intention to leave his wife behind, though he was desirous that she should propose to accompany him. Hitherto, she had been carefully watched, though unknown to herself, she having attributed the continual presence of the count to the devoted affection he professed for her. She was now informed that he had received a summons to join the squadron he commanded at Leghorn, and thither she also went, and was received with many demonstrations of respect.;;; Orloff 's scheme was fast approaching its completion, and the Empress Catharine, exulting in its success, prepared to shower honors on those who had labored so zealously in her behalf.;;; It was a lovely day, with the blue sky only as an Italian sky can be, when the Princess Tarranakoff, escorted by her husband, stepped into a magnificent barge.;;; Gay, and in the highest spirits, the princess laughed and chatted with attendants, little dreaming of the horrible fate impending over her. It had been arranged that she should be permitted the indulgence of a marine excursion, and she was assisted up the side of the vessel by her obsequious husband.;;; The lookers-on saw the sails spread without suspicion, and waved their farewells, deeming that they should soon witness the return of the party.;;; The hapless princess was doomed never to revisit the shores of Italy.--On board the ship were none save the creatures of Orloff; and now, having his wife completely in his power, he revealed his treachery in all its blackness and fiendish ingenuity.--The delicate wrists of the princess were manacled, and the granddaughter of the Czar was taken back to her native land, not, as she had been led to expect, with the honors due to her rank, and the prospect of a throne, but as a wretched prisoner.;;; It would be utterly impossible to depict the agony of mind she must have endured during this gloomy voyage, but probably no human being ever suffered greater, For during several years after her arrival, she was the inmate of a dungeon in the Russian capital.;;; Catharine triumphed in the success of her plan, and amply rewarded those who had too successfully carried it out. Europe might exclaim against her, but her object was gained, and the Princess Tarranakoff was in her power.;;; In her dark prison-house, the unhappy young woman spent, it is said, six years, and her deliverance came in a dreadful fashion.;;; The autumnal equinox was at hand, and a furious gale raged in St. Petersburg.;;; The angry waves of the Neva lashed the sides of the prison in which she was confined.;;; Absorbed in sorrowful recollections, she scarcely heeded the storm, until one noticed that the floor of her dungeon was wet; then the horrible thought crossed her mind, that the river was rising.;;; Perceiving that the water gained in height, she shrieked aloud; she strove, by every means in her power, to attract the attention of her jailor.;;; But no human aid was at hand.;;; She raised herself as high as possible by means of the articles of furniture in her cell, but still the waters pursued her. The whole of the ground-floor of the prison was laid under water.;;; When the gale had passed over, and the impetuous Neva returned to its ordinary course, her jailor found only the corpse of what had been the victim of Count Alexey Orloff 's treachery, and the jealous hatred of Catharine Alexiewna.
