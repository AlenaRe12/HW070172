TEXT: The following is an extract from a letter written by a distinguished Virginian, who has been an active participant in the deliberation of the Carolinas for a few weeks past@§@;;; "The act to call a Convention passed both Houses (and both very full) unanimously. --I have not seen an individual, or even heard of a man in the State, who is opposed to secession from the Union.;;; This will be done within three days after the Convention meets, on December 17th. Both the South Carolina Senators have resigned their seats in Congress.;;; The private dispatches from Georgia and Florida assert the readiness of those States for secession.;;; Alabama will not be far behind, according to like reports.;;; A private dispatch today, from Milledgeville, from a gentleman of highest standing, of talent and great discretion, says that the Legislature of Georgia will certainly call a Convention.;;; The refusal of that body to elect a Senator in place of Iverson, is a significant indication of its willingness to secession.;;; The greatest enthusiasm continues here.;;; Speeches delivered every night to the same unwearied crowd.";;; The views of Mr. Lincoln about the use of force in the case of secession seem to be borne out by some of the Republican papers at the North.;;; In his Leavenworth speech he said@§@;;; "Your own statement is, that if the Black Republicans elect a President, you won't stand it! You will break up the Union.;;; That will be your act, not ours.;;; So, if constitutionally we elect a President, and, therefore, you undertake to destroy the Union, it will be our duty to deal with you as old John Brown was dealt with.;;; We shall try to do our duty.;;; We hope and believe that in no section will a majority so act as to render such extreme measures necessary! ";;; The Boston Atlas, commenting on the position of affairs in South Carolina, gives the following as the programme which would be carried out by the Federal Government in a case of dissolution@§@;;; "If the Federal Government should attempt to invade the domain of State-Rights, that would be despotism and cause of resistance; but there is no such cause, and there will be none.;;; Should any State attempt to resume powers expressly yielded to the Federal Government, that would be treason, and would justify the exercise of forcible means by the Federal Government to bring back the offending State to its allegiance to the Constitution and the Union.;;; But no such case has arisen — none will arise.;;; There is, therefore, no existing right of secession, and the claim for it is utterly indefensible.;;; Secession ought not to be, and that is one of the strongest reasons why it never will be.";;; "Secondly, the slave States have not the power to secede.;;; Unless permitted by the Federal Government quietly to withdraw, they cannot go. It is absurd to suppose that a President and a Congress and a Judiciary, sworn to maintain the Constitution and the laws, will ever permit a State to secede.;;; If they should, they would violate their oaths and become participants in the crime of treason.--The only other possible method of secession is by violence, involving the nullification of the Federal laws and armed resistance to the Federal authority.;;; In such a contest the slave States would be speedily and deservedly crushed by the strong arm of power.;;; They have neither the wealth, the intelligence, the arts, the arms, nor the character requisite to maintain the struggle.";;; A meeting was held at Woodstock, Shenandoah county, on Monday last, at which, after speeches by Gen. Williams and Hon. Mr. Harris, resolutions were adopted in favor of calling a State Convention, to consider federal relations, and requesting the Lincoln voters in that county to emigrate to a free State.;;; It is said summary action will soon be taken in the case of George Rye, Republican elector, who is a resident in that county.;;; The Culpeper C. H. ( Va. ) Observer says@§@ " Some of our young gentlemen have mounted the blue cockade and the Virginia button, while others sport the red, white and blue rosettes.;;; We hope they will not come in collision during these exciting times.";;; The South Carolina Legislature, before adjourning, accepted the resignation of U. S. Senator Hammond.;;; In the Charleston papers several cards have appeared, calling on gentlemen to stand for places in the State Convention.;;; These gentlemen have declined being nominated in that way, and the Courier, commending their determination, says@§@;;; There should be no division, or distraction, or personal element in the councils and purposes of Electors, called upon to constitute a body clothed with the sovereignty of the State, and charged with the weighty and solemn responsibilities of a new political adjustment.--In the spirit of the remarks of the Hon. W. F. Colcock, whose eloquent appeal, on Monday evening, was so cordially received, we bespeak unity of action and a toleration of opinions and personal preferences, in subordination to the great duty and issue before us.;;; The electoral body of Charleston must seek out diligently the wisest and worthiest citizens, of ripe judgment and approved fidelity, and must and should call such, and such only, to this great office.;;; Those who are most worthy will be most reluctant to accept; but, in such an emergency, the deliberately expressed choice of the Electors should overrule personal considerations.;;; Let no rash pledges be given, and let there be no encouragement to personal aspiration or factious combinations.;;; In good time, measures can be taken to secure a proper and responsible selection of names worthy of the choice of the people.;;; The Mercury, under the caption, "The ball rolls on," says@§@;;; The Clinch Rifles, of Augusta, telegraphed yesterday to the Washington Light Infantry, of this city, "We are ready to go with you." The Minute Men of Norfolk, Va., have written to this city for the pattern of a Palmetto flag.;;; Three hundred men are ready in that city to move — paying their own expenses — to the assistance of any State that the Federal Government may attempt to coerce into submission.;;; A New York letter to the Charleston Courier says@§@;;; As you are, perhaps, aware, the Wide A wake organization is not to be discontinued.;;; Among them are a majority of the 7th Regiment -- National Guard.;;; As far as I know, in every other Regiment in the city the members are conservative Union men, and betray but little joy at the election of Lincoln.;;; The same paper has the following item@§@;;; The steamship James Adger reports a specie list of $230,000 for our banks and dealers.;;; Several additions, in considerable amounts, have been made within the past week to our specie supply in Banks and in private hands.;;; A telegraphic dispatch says that the Military Convention, in session at Milledgeville, Ga., representing sixty-seven companies, on the question of the immediate secession of Georgia, voted two to one in favor of the measure.;;; The minority was in favor of resistance, but doubted the expediency of the resolution.

The working classes are beginning to feel the pinch, at their very hearthstones.;;; I have already mentioned the suspension of trade, by two leading clothing houses in this city, who jointly employed 700 hands, and now must be added the discharge of sixty more, from one of the principal silver manufacturing, establishments in the city.;;; Some of these were parties who had served for years as apprentices in the establishment.;;; The Williamsburg tailors — of whom many hundreds just now have nothing to do — are to have a public meeting this week, to consult as to what is best to be done.;;; If they have no work they cannot starve, they say, when the granaries of the country and the store-houses of New York are overflowing with plenty of food.;;; Captain Rynders again turned up at the Toombs Police Court to-day, to respond to the charge of assault and battery upon Mr. Tappan, in the matter of the African boys.;;; Judge Edmonds, on behalf of the prosecution, desired to withdraw the case, and the Court having no objections, it was so ordered.;;; Before leaving the Court the Captain made a characteristic speech in self- defence, but there were but few to listen to him save the newspaper reporters!;;; Much excitement exists in Brooklyn to-day, in consequence of a horrible murder, last evening, in the town of New Lots, a small village about two miles south of Brooklyn, on the Coney Island Plank-Road.;;; The victim was a respectable and wealthy farmer, named Theodore Colyer, who had been to New York to sell some market produce in the afternoon.;;; The proceeds of this amounted to about $100, and it is supposed that to rob him of the money was the motive for the murder.;;; The unfortunate man, after coming home, took tea with his family, at 6 o'clock, after which he went out to a neighboring grocery to settle an account, and while there incautiously exhibited a roll of bills.;;; There were two strangers in the store at the time — Germans — who behaved suspiciously, and when Colyer went out they were seen to follow him.;;; Nothing more was seen of him until daylight this morning, when his wife discovered his dead body in a barn near by. The skull of deceased was split in two and the brains scattered all over the floor, presenting a most awful spectacle.;;; The names of the supposed murderers are not known, but the police are on their track, and have no doubt of bringing them to justice.;;; The tides have been unusually high for several days past — a remarkable circumstance, seeing that the wind has been strong from the northwest, but accounted for on the theory of heavy easterly winds off shore.;;; The United States frigate Cumberland was towed to the Brooklyn Navy-Yard this morning, to receive her new armament.;;; Money was "hard" on all hands to-day, and rates range all the way up from 7 to 10a 12 per cent.

Kluge, an American citizen, and employee of the Panama Railroad Company, complained to the American Consul of the manner in which he and others had been molested by an English sentry, and the case was taken under investigation and laid before Flag-Officer Montgomery.;;; The same night, as Lieutenant Fitzhugh, of the United States sloop St. Marys, and a son of Captain Engle, of the United States Navy, commanding the Chirique expedition, were passing the English Consulate, they were hailed by the sentinel, to which they made no reply, and upon attempting to pass were stopped, the sentry presenting his bayonet.;;; The sergeant of the guard was sent for, and when requested to go for the lieutenant did so, after ordering the sentry to shoot them down if they attempted to escape.;;; On the arrival of the lieutenant they were released.;;; On Monday, Flag-Officer Montgomery addressed a communication to Capt. Miller, of the Clio, with a statement of the circumstances that transpired Saturday night, as also the complaints made through the American Consul, and demanded the immediate discontinuance of the practice, regarding it as aggressive towards the United States, and unless it was immediately discontinued he would at once adopt measures for the re-establishment of the neutrality of the city and Isthmus of Panama.;;; The flag-officer also opened a correspondence with the Intendant of Panama, with the view of fixing the responsibility where it belongs.;;; On the 23d, Flag-Officer Montgomery addressed a communication to Capt. Miller, in reference to the arrest of Dr. Kluge, on the night of the 21st, by the guard in front of the French Consulate, when he was detained a prisoner till morning.;;; Subsequently, Montgomery addressed Capt. Miller another letter, suggesting the duties of guards furnished for protection of Consulates in foreign ports from ships-of-war, and gave that officer to understand that their operations must be confined to the precincts of the Consulates, and not one foot beyond; and had he known in time of the imprisonment of Dr. Kluge, he would have employed the necessary means to procure his instant release.

"No good." "Why do you drink?" "I must have it."

I shall never forget!;;; He stood up and said@§@ "All I can say is, I must have it." "Why?" "I feel as if there were insects in my veins!;;; Oh! it is horrible, horrible!;;; I touch my coat, I touch my hands, and I jump!;;; Oh! I shall go mad — mad — mad!;;; If I could not get it without having a sound tooth torn out of my jaw. bring the instrument and wrench it cut; I must have the drink, you see — so I get it. And then I stand still, that I may not disturb its effect.;;; That's what I want — I want relief; and I feel it. Quick, quick, now, it sends the blood through my veins; the insects are gone, and I begin to perspire.;;; Yes, I am better, better!--It's what I want — it's coming — it's coming — it has come to me — relief — like a flash of summer lightning and it has gone, and I get another. ""Then," I said, "you will die." "I am afraid I shall, can you save me!" "Not unless you stop drinking." "I can't die; I haven't offered a prayer to God for sixteen years." " You must give it up." "I can't."-- I said, " God will help you." "No he won't." "I will," said I, "my wife and I will take care of you for four days, if you will, I have just four days to spare for you." We took him, though we could get no promise from him.--We nursed him night and day. The third afternoon he sat with me, his hand in mine, and I spoke to him of God and Christ and eternity.;;; He said, "I am a man of some common sense, I believe; and am very well aware that I can never be happy in another world." He then went out and cut his throat from ear to ear. Oh, my friends, shall we not try to save our fellow-men from such a fate?-- From a Speech of John B. Gough.

TEXT: Foreign News and Gossip.;;; Mr. Rarey 's farewell to England;;; --On Saturday, October 27th, the great American horse-tamer took final leave of his English friends at the Crystal Palace, at Sydenham. --The exhibition presented no feature of novelty; beyond the fact of its being a leave-taking and the numerous audience which it attracted.;;; The whole of the immense Handel Orchestra was crammed to the roof, and presented a most imposing appearance.;;; The same may be said of every portion of the transept that was not railed off as an arena, whilst the first, second, and even third galleries, exhibited each its dense and eager rows of human faces.;;; The Russian Ambassador and a numerous suite occupied the Queen 's gallery, and there were also scattered amongst the lower crowed an exceedingly numerous and conspicuous sprinkling of. Orientals.;;; Mr. Rarey began with Cruiser, who is now a model of docility and patience.;;; Like Col. Crockett 's squirrels, he comes down without the trouble of firing.;;; He bends his knee for the strap, and falls with case, if not with dignity, the moment it becomes his cue to do so. He looked thin on Saturday, and his coat was rough; but neither of those symptoms is uncommon with horses at this season of the year.--Cruiser, who is now the property of Mr. Rarey, goes with him to America, to assist in disseminating the new philosophy of horse-taming.;;; After him came a chestnut, which was, if possible, still more docile; but here the harmony of the arena terminated.;;; When the chestnut had been duly hobbled, tumbled, and otherwise done for, the whole transept suddenly became vocal with the unearthly screams of the Irish mare, who was about to receive her first initiation into the restraints of a civilized manage. This animal and another horse of fierce disposition were brought into subjection, and then Mr. Rarey delivered his farewell, in a few simple, manly words, full of friendly regrets and good feeling.;;; He acknowledged the unfailing kindness he had always received from the people of England, and the fair hearing which had been given to his rather novel theories.;;; He hoped he had done some good in the cause of humanity, by pleading as he had done the cause of our best friend, the horse, and by showing, to the best of his humble ability, the means by which its usefulness might be preserved without those protracted and brutal systems of training which at present caused cruel and needless suffering.;;; He ( Mr. Rarey ) was about leaving England, perhaps forever; but he should to his last moment retain a grateful recollection of the friends he had made and the kindness he had received during his rather protracted sojourn in the Old Country.;;; This address was vehemently cheered, and its delivery brought the interesting farewell performance to a successful termination.;;; The English Press on the Prince 's New York reception.;;; --The English are immensely proud of the way in which their Prince was received in New York.;;; The London News says@§@ "The gain to both countries is enormous-- literally incalculable, being of that profoundly vital and moral kind that cannot be reckoned by commercial arithmetic.;;; An immediate mercantile advantage, a tariff, a treaty, a railway concession, has, of course, a definite value, and can be at once appreciated by all. But the friendly disposition that tends insensibly to the amicable settlement of disputed questions, and facilitates a thorough oneness of policy and interests, is a permanent gain of a far higher kind." And the London Star says that "the Prince has been received in New York with a demonstrativeness of interest and admiration which only the heir apparent to the crown of a kindred and friendly nation, the son of a mother respected abroad, as she is beloved at home, for her conspicuous personal virtues, could look for among a republican people.";;; A Costly present.;;; --The following anecdote is going the round of the foreign journals@§@ When the late Madame Bosio, the eminent cantatrice, who died not long since at St. Petersburg, was singing one night at a private party at the residence of Prince --she noticed a beautiful Havana lap-dog as white as snow, lying on a sofa.;;; Madame Bosio, soon after wards, at the request of Prince --,sang a favorite air by Giluka.;;; This piece was received with enthusiastic applause, and the Prince, addressing the fair artist, said, " What can I do, Madame, in acknowledgment of the pleasure you have given us by singing that beautiful production of our national composer?" "Give me your little dog, Prince, " she immediately replied.;;; "You shall have him to-morrow, Madame." The next day the servant brought the animal.;;; As it was very cold that day, the Prince had wrapped the little fellow in an Indian cashmere worth 15,000f., and he begged Madame Bosio to "accept the dog with his wrapper.";;; Collection in Dublin for Capt. Wilson of the Minnie Schiffer.;;; --Since Mr. Persse, United States Consul at Galway, forwarded to the Dublin Evening Mail office ten guineas, as his subscription to Capt. John Wilson, who so nobly came to the rescue of the sufferers in the Connaught, numerous citizens of Dublin have followed his example.;;; The Mail says@§@;;; "We suggest that a committee should at once be formed for the purpose of taking charge of the work of guiding and eliciting the expression of the public gratitude to the gallant Captain of the Minnie Schiffer.;;; We shall ourselves feel pleasure in doing all we can to assist, and we have no doubt that all our contemporaries (not otherwise pre-occupied) will co-operate with us in so truly catholic an undertaking.;;; Some of them, indeed, have already taken steps in that direction.";;; The sword of Tiberius.;;; --The curious in antiquities will be glad to learn that the sword of Tiberius is for sale at Mayence, among the collection of Joseph Gold, recently deceased.;;; It was discovered in that town (the Moguntium of the Romans ) some years since, while excavating for a new fortification.;;; It has occupied the learned classical writers of Germany much, and they have written as many pamphlets about it as did our antiquarians about "Bill Stump's mark."

His Court, though externally splendid, is austerely regulated, and his privy purse is estimated at Lot more than 4,260 Roman dollars per annum, though offerings from the faithful in various countries have (especially in the case of his present Holiness,) brought occasional augmentation to these narrow means.;;; Among the thousand chambers of the Vatican, few, and those not the largest, are reserved for his residence.;;; In the Quirinal Palace he has a more magnificent suite, but his villa on the lake of Albano, and that lately purchased at Porto d'anzio, are surpassed in scale and grandeur by many country seats of gentlemen and noblemen in England.;;; Though always appearing abroad with a cortege of chariots and mounted guards, in private his habits are simple, his dress entirely white, with a gold embroidered cross on the slipper, which is kissed in the act of that homage he usually dispenses with from non-Catholics at the presentation, and of which he himself sets the example, so far as Christian humility is implied, by kissing the feet of the priests (who are generally poor and strangers,) during the solemnity of Holy Thursday.--He holds no levees, but access to him is easy, through proper officials, for persons of almost every rank, with no other requirements as to etiquette of costume than black evening dress without gloves, and the veil for females.;;; As to the private life of Pius IX., he daily celebrates Mass in his private chapel, and attends another Mass said by a chaplain; dedicates the entire morning, till and early dinner, to his duties; then drives out, and (when beyond the city walls,) usually walks; returns again to occupy his hours, till a rather late supper, in that routine of endless and ever-prescribed engagements that render the life of a Pope little else than a magnificent slavery.;;; Among these engagements, audiences, official and private, are not the least prominent or wearisome; and it is said his present Holiness has literally spent the day till 7 P. M., in one series of receptions.;;; Most of the ecclesiastics enrolled in the Papal Court rank as prelates; and this household is at present composed of the Cardinal, the Secretary of State, (Perfect of the Apostolic Palaces,) a majordomo, a maestro di camera, an auditor, the maestro of the sacred palaces, (who is always a Dominican and head of the censorship over the press,) ten private chamberlains, 102 private supernumerary chamberlains, all, like the former, of practical rank.

Yet the result of all this prolonged effort and enormous outlay had been nothing but a continued series of disappointments.;;; One solitary success is recorded as having been achieved, on 'a small scale,' by Mr. Shaw, collector at Dharwar, who, taking up the enterprise in 1840, upon an area of only 220 acres, developed the results so rapidly that in 1851 there were 31,688 'kupas' planted with American, and 224,314 with native cotton, and in 1856 the area increased to 156,316 kupas appropriated to the American, and 230,567 to the native variety of the plant.;;; It does not appear that Mr. Shaw was assisted by any Government grant in this work; and, at all events, all direct co-operation of the State with the cultivation of cotton is now summarily abandoned."

Gill, the City Engineer, and Mr. Davis, the Superintendent of the Water Works.;;; From Mr. Gill 's report on the subject, we make the following extract@§@;;; "It is proposed to build the new reservoir on the east side of the present one, and to raise the water line of the present reservoir three feet higher, and to build the new reservoir to the same height.;;; "The new reservoir will be 500 feet long by 450 feet wide at the surface of the water, and will be divided into two equal parts by a division embankment extending through it. It will contain, when full, about thirty millions gallons of water.;;; The filter beds, two in number, will be located on the northern side of the new reservoir.;;; They will each be 246 feet long by 150 feet wide.;;; The filtering medium will be sand and gravel, and of sufficient capacity to filter about four and a half millions gallons of water every 24 hours.;;; "The capacity of the new reservoir will be about thirty millions gallons.;;; The present reservoir is estimated to hold about ten millions gallons more — making the storage capacity of both reservoirs about forty millions gallons — which is equal to about twenty days supply, at the present rate of consumption in the city.;;; Both the new and old reservoirs will be arranged by means of stop cocks and pipes that the water can be drawn at pressure from any one of the several compartments, for the purpose of cleansing or making any repairs to them.;;; "The very turbid character of the James river during freshets might lead to some apprehensions with regard to clogging up, to which the filtering medium might be subject during such periods.--But when we come to consider that the water of James river is never very turbid for more than four or five days at a time, and that there will be no difficulty in stopping the pumps at such times; and also, that the water will be some twenty days in passing through the different compartments of the reservoir, it is evident that by this arrangement the water will have ample time to deposit its sedimentary load before it reaches the filter beds.;;; "If, however, at any time the filtering medium should become clogged, the filtering process will be so arranged that the action of the water in passing through the filter beds can be reversed and the sedimentary deposit washed off and out of the reservoir, by means of waste pipes, which are common to the whole system.;;; This plan has been successfully tried by several water companies both in England and Scotland.;;; "In carrying out this plan more land will be required on the east side of the reservoir than is afforded by the recent purchase from Mr. Wooldridge.;;; It will, therefore, become expedient to purchase the balance of the ground between the reservoir and Hollywood Cemetery.;;; If the reservoir is confined to the present narrow limits, it will become necessary to resort to heavy walls of masonry, with the view to economise space, which will increase the cost of the proposed reservoir fully as much as the price asked for the land.;;; This land will ultimately be required for reservoir purposes, and it will be economy for the city to purchase it now, with the view of the future extension of the works, and also for the purpose of keeping off from the reservoirs all objectionable encroachments.;;; The importance of constructing a new reservoir is evident, when we take into consideration the very limited capacity of the present one and that it is so badly arranged that it is impossible to clean out the deposit of mud which has been accumulating in it for years, without depriving the city of water.;;; "The following is the estimated cost of improvement@§@ Embankment, $35,000; masonry of affluent and influent chambers, $10,000; cost of filtering arrangements, $25,000; cost of stopcocks, gates and pipes $23,000; cost of land required.;;; $5,000. Total $98,000.;;; On motion of Mr. Hill, the report was laid on the table and ordered to be printed for the use of members.;;; On motion of Mr. Saunders, the sum of $5,000 was appropriated, with which to purchase additional land for the new reservoir.;;; On motion, the Council adjourned.

Jefford, a man of some notoriety both here and elsewhere, made his appearance before the Mayor yesterday, to answer the charge of stealing $30 from Martin L. Covington, on the 15th of May last.;;; Mr. Covington testified, that he left Norfolk, on the steamer " Curtis Peck," in route for home, and being anxious to see all the places of historical note along the river, made the acquaintance of the prisoner by asking him a few questions.;;; Finding Jefford to be quite intelligent, Covington entered into conversation with him, and when the breakfast bell rang, the two left the deck together, Covington going to the bar and taking a julep, at the invitation of Jefford.;;; After imbibing the two started to the breakfast saloon, but had only gone a few steps, when they discovered a very pleasant gentleman sitting at a table, passing cards to and fro, and offering to bet two to one that no man could name either one after seeing the faces of all, so rapidly could he pass them. -- Jefford, having no designs on Covington, asked to see the pasteboards manipulated, and doubtless believing that he could turn an honest penny, pulled out a roll of notes to bet, and then inquired of Covington as to the kind of money he had. Covington replied that he had very little of any kind with him. Jefford wished to know if he had any small notes.-- Covington replied that he had three $10 notes, and supposing Jefford wished to get change for a $30 note, pulled them out and allowed J. to take them.;;; Jefford then rolled the notes together, laid them down, raised the wrong card by accident, and the gentleman at the table pocketed the pile, Jefford remarking to Covington, on losing the bet, that the money was gone C. replied that he hoped his was not, that he had no interest in the bet, never bet a dollar in his life, and must have his money.;;; Jefford insisted that C. was partner in the bet, which C denied, and reported the circumstance to Capt. Gifford, who set about recovering the money.;;; Jefford had paid his way to Richmond, but attempted to leave the boat at City Point, where the winning man went on shore.;;; He, however, was prevented from doing so, and, on getting to this city, was turnover to the police.;;; Berry Grubbs was called for the defence, and testified that he took passage for Richmond in the Peck that morning, getting on board at the Williamsburg wharf — that Covington advised him against playing with the card man, as he had lost $30 that morning — and that Jefford, Covington, and himself, took two or three drinks together, in the course of the morning.;;; Other evidence was adduced during the investigation, at the conclusion of which the Mayor remanded the accused for further examination before the Hustings Court, at its December term.

TEXT: The Committee of reception in reply to the Slanders of the New York Times.;;; We subjoin the declaration of the committee of reception upon the Prince of Wales, visit to this city, regretting only that it was not made long ago. It is but too true that truth is lame, while falsehood travels with the rapidity of lightning.;;; A falsehood uttered by a worthless rascal, who was apparently sent here for no other purpose than to libel us, has been circulated in England; has been eagerly seized upon by the London Times as an excuse for denouncing us as the very offscouring of the human race; has, in a word, accomplished its errand of mischief — and now, undo who can what it has done.;;; The committee, in our opinion, acted most unwisely in deferring this declaration so long.;;; No man in these days of newspapers and rapid circulation of intelligence, can afford to shut himself up in his own dignity, and leave it to time to do justice to his character when it is assailed.;;; No man can neglect the smallest lie published to his disadvantage, without manifest danger to his reputation.;;; Truth, they tell us, is mighty, and it will prevail.--And so it is, and so it will, after the victim of a lie shall have been ruined beyond the power of mortal redemption — after his prospects shall have been destroyed, his hopes blasted his health shattered, his heart broken — after his body shall have been laid beneath the clove of the valley.;;; And as it is with the individual man, so it is with a community.;;; It cannot afford to overlook any lie, no matter how insignificant in itself, or how worthless the source from whence it proceeds.;;; It should be taken always at the first hop — denounced at once, flung back in the teeth of the slanderer.;;; We much regret that the committee did not make this publication before.;;; It appears, then, that the reporter of the N York Times was in lodgings in a corner of the city, and that he staid there during the whole time of the Prince 's visit.;;; We were going to say that he saw nothing of what he describes; but that is a matter of course.;;; He could not have seen it, for it did not happen.;;; We will amend our statement, therefore, and say that had things happened as he pretended, he could not have known it personally, for he could not have seen what was going on. At the same time, he might very easily have ascertained the whole truth, had he been so disposed.;;; But it suited his purpose to manufacture a malicious lie. He was doubtless sent here to write a libel upon us, because we were slaveholders, and it suited the purpose of the New York Times to represent all slaveholders as vulgar brutes, incapable of behaving with even decency, far less propriety.;;; The lies of the London Times ' correspondent are all copied from the correspondent of the New York Times. One lied deliberately; the other copied his lies, and the New York Tribunes, supporting one batch of lies by the other, says that the New York Times must tell the truth, because the London Times says the same thing.;;; The correspondent of the London Times was not even in the city.;;; He stopped in Baltimore, and staid there all the time the Prince was here.;;; The gusto with which the London Times returns to this favorite subject is refreshing.;;; "Delenda est Carthage " is now the only word the Thunderer has for Richmond.;;; Richmond must be destroyed, not by war, pestilence and famine, not by fire and sword, not after the fashion of Carthage or Jerusalem, but by neglect. No royal cortege is hereafter to enliven its doomed streets — no royal hope of a King-loving people is to breathe its polluted atmosphere — no magnanimous Briton is to sport his burly carcass from this day forth within its accursed precincts.;;; The decree has gone forth.;;; From this day, Richmond must look to her own spit-boxes; John Bull will no longer supply her with inspectors.;;; She must depend upon her own unassisted imagination for fifty ideas in connection with hip-baths and spit-boxes, and all the abominations so congenial to John 's taste.;;; John will not condescend, henceforth, to enlighten her even upon the condition of his belly, upon the stuffing he undergoes at dinner, upon the washings of his feet, the condition of his sheets, or any of the little private incidents which figure so largely in all he has heretofore written about here.;;; John will come here no more.;;; The London Times says the Prince ought not to have come here, and surely, no loyal Englishman will go where the heir apparent ought not to go.--Here is what it says@§@;;; The truth is, Richmond is a place which the Prince should never have been taken to visit.;;; If there be a place justly odious to the feelings of Englishmen and their sovereign.;;; It is that where the human anomaly which is now almost the only produce of Virginia, is ruthlessly sold for consumption in the dreary plantations of the South. From such a spot every humane and intelligent traveller turns aside with invincible repugnance, and we can hardly regret that those who were so ill-advised as to turn aside from their path to come in contact with this abominable traffic should have a specimen of the quality of the population that subsists on the buying and selling of human flesh.;;; Considering that a large proportion of the Queen 's revenue is derived from duties upon the products shipped to her by this race so accursed in her sight, this denunciation will do pretty well.;;; We only wish that it did not bear too great a resemblance to the "Fence," reproaching as a rascal the person from whom he receives his stolen goods.;;; If we are rascals for owning and selling negroes, what are the British purchasers of the products which these slaves create?;;; What is the Queen herself, who derives a revenue from them?;;; What is the Parliament, and what is the Ministry ?;;; We have wandered too far from our purpose, which was to lay the subjoined paper before the public@§@;;; Visit of the Prince of Wales to Richmond;;; It is marvelous now fast a lie will travel, and how difficult it is to put a stop to it when once the steam is up. When the account of the reception of the Prince of Wales in Richmond first appeared in the New York Times, it was apparent to the committee of the Council and citizens, that some professional Munchausen of the press had been employed to promulgate a wholesale slander upon the people of Richmond; and that the article had been accordingly manufactured out of the raw material of falsehood to suit the demand.;;; The committee knew positively and personally that not a word was true relating to the insults alleged to have been offered in the Capitol or elsewhere; that no event transpired, and no word was uttered, which could give the least color to the statement in the "Times." They were aware of the fact, on undoubted authority, that the correspondent of the "Times," though in the city, was confined to the house, in a remote part of the suburbs, during the whole of the day, and was not an-eye-witness of any of the scenes he pretends to describe.;;; Yet they did not choose to dignity the petty malice which originated a foul slander upon a whole community, by giving it the importance attached to a public denial.;;; Their guests expressed themselves, and snowed themselves, gratified with the reception accorded them, and that was enough.;;; It was altogether immaterial whether the diseased part of Northern sentiment was propitiated or not, and the sound portion could be relied on to recognize the character of the statement by the source it came from, and the features of untruth upon its face.;;; When the Duke of Newcastle publicly denied the truth of every allegation, it was natural to suppose the wrong would have been confessed, and the charge put at rest.;;; Yet, more recently the London Times has taken up the hue and cry, and to this hour the New York Times and its kin are trying to make themselves and their readers believe it by the force of repetition.;;; The slander travels at a pace which makes it hopeless that the truth can ever overtake it. Having reached the people of England, who may be innocently misled into the belief that it has some foundation, if now becomes a duty to the people of Richmond, of the State, and to all who yet retain a regard for our national reputation, that the proper stamp should be placed upon it by those who had charge of the reception of the Prince, and were personally present during the entire visit to the Church, the Capitol, and the Governor's House; and, accordingly, we take public notice of it, and declare it a sheer fabrication, from beginning to end.;;; The Committee of reception.

They make quite as respectable a show in point of size as the shipping in the harbor of New York forty years ago. As the deepening of the channel in the James proceeds, we shall be able to bring larger and larger vessels to our wharves, and with the full completion of the York River Railroad, a stream will be brought to our very doors, which will afford an ample additional outlet for the trade that will be concentrated here by our numerous railroads.;;; With such facilities for greatness and independence, Virginia should blush at the idea of being tributary to any other State.

We ought not to suffer ourselves to be degraded by these miserable abolitionists.;;; If they will come and ask me for a negro, I will give them as many as they will promise to take care of, for they are an expense to me; but they shall not steal my property and then denounce me." Others say, "let us wait until Lincoln does something.;;; He has been duly elected by the people, and he may be better than our fears." I suppose the masses to be of this latter opinion.;;; While in Madison county, a large tract of land was pointed out to me which had recently been sold for $55 per acre.;;; This does not look like there is any pecuniary crisis, nor is there any in the country.;;; The people have food and raiment, and as much money as they need, though not quite as much as they want.;;; The Reformers have been holding a "big meeting" in this neighborhood, and several ministers officiated, one of whom was from Kentucky.;;; Last Sunday was a great day with the "little folks" in this region.;;; It was the anniversary celebration of the Sunday School connected with the Hebron Church.;;; After the speaking, cakes and candies and nuts and many other good things were spread out, for the children to eat as much as they wanted, and to fill their pockets.;;; Then came the awarding of premiums.;;; Two little girls had memorized seven thousand passages of Scripture, and a boy had memorized twelve hundred. These received beautiful presents.;;; Then the vote was taken as to continuing the school through the winter.;;; All the children were in favor of doing so. The Baptist Sunday Schools are giving up the practice of "suspending" for the winter.;;; They ought never to have begun it. The winter is in some respects more favorable to country schools than any other season.;;; Rev. Dr. Fonerdon, of your city, has been preaching at Hebron, and it is thought he will be called to the care of the church.
