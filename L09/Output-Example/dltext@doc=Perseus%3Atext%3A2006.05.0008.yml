When he retook a city from the insurgents, he received a reward proportionate to the service he had rendered.;;; For instance, the retaking of Sung-Kiang brought the gallant Colonel the sum of 87,500 francs.;;; Such remuneration would have stimulated the ardor of men more scrupulous than Mr. Ward.;;; The city of Tseng-Pow, near Shanghai, was taken by the rebels.;;; The Tou-Tai was in great trepidation, but Ward re-assured him, and offered to make all right for a personal reward of 300,000 francs.;;; Arrived at Tseng-Pow he gave the signal of assault, and was received by a shower of balls.;;; But Ward is brave, and he determined to prove himself worthy the confidence of the Tou -Tai.;;; Twice repulsed, twice he returned to the charge Climbing the walls with but about fifty of his followers, he found himself face to face with the chief of the Tai -Pings; he fired at him twice, but missed.;;; "You rascal," replied his adversary in good English, "I'll show you that I can fire better than you," and he did show it by shooting the Colonel in the stomach and leg. Yet Ward escaped, though the greater portion of his men were lost.;;; He is now at Shanghai, and, as he is of good constitution, it is probable that in a few weeks he will be up again and at the head of a band of brigands, anxious to repair his ill-luck."

TEXT: A political Rioter with a sword Blade in his back.;;; --During the election riot at Illinois-town, Ill., a man named John Denoar was stabbed in the back with a sword-cane.--The weapon was driven in about midway of the spinal column, and then broken off within about two inches of the body.;;; It was found impossible to extract the weapon, and Denoar was conveyed from Illinois-town to the Health Office.;;; A physician was called in, and endeavored to pull out the weapon with a small pair of forceps or pincers.;;; He applied the pincers some half a dozen times, and pulled with all the strength he could command, but so firmly was the steel transfixed in the bone that the pincers invariably slipped off, and the "claws finally became injured in such a manner that the pincers were rendered useless.;;; The Doctor endeavored to loosen the weapon in a variety of ways, but to no purpose.;;; It had been driven in with so much force that it was even more strongly transfixed in the bone than a nail driven into a stick of wood.;;; Dr. Smith finally procured a pair of shoemaker's nippers and made another effort.;;; After one or two trials he succeeded in securing a good "purchase" upon the weapon and extracted it. It measured in all five inches -- three inches of which had penetrated the spinal column, and there remained firmly imbedded for twelve or fourteen hours.

HEADER: The Falsely alleged insult to the Prince of Wales.
TEXT: The Falsely alleged insult to the Prince of Wales.;;; The New York Express, in a late issue, took occasion to repoll the infamous slanders propagated by the correspondent of the New York Times, relative to the treatment offered to the Prince of Wales on his visit to this city.;;; In the meantime the "own correspondent" of the London Times had written to that paper and had said that with the exception of the insult at Richmond, the Prince had been everywhere well received.;;; The New York Tribune replies to the Express, and endeavors to sustain the affirmative of this proposition by referring to this letter of the "own correspondent." Thereupon, the New York Herald says@§@;;; "The Tribune, commenting upon an article in the Express, declares that the reporter of the London Times speaks of the disturbances at Richmond, 'on the occasion of the Prince of Wales ' visit, from personal observation.;;; What does the Tribune know about it?;;; The fact is, that neither the core pendent of the Tribune, nor of the London Times was anywhere near Richmond during the Prince 's stay there, but remained at Baltimore!;;; the London Telegraph was the only English paper represented at Richmond at that time. One falsehood cannot be made to sustain others, in the way the Tribune attempts.";;; This "attempt" of the Tribune was made in the face of the Duke of Newcastle 's positive declaration, publicly made, and printed in all the newspapers of the day, that there was no ground whatever for the charge, that the conduct of the people here had been uniformly respectful to the Prince, and that he had no reason whatever to complain of his reception.;;; What object can the Tribune have in persisting in this falsehood 1.;;; Its correspondents invented a monstrous system of lies in Kansas, and it has since attempted to pass them off as history.;;; We can easily enough discern the object there; but what can it be here! The minds of the Northern people are already sufficiently poisoned against us. Why intensify the rancor by any farther falsehoods if Lincoln is elected, and is not that enough?;;; Until of late, it was customary with public journals to correct any false statement they had been betrayed into making as soon as the mistake had been discovered. -- That good old custom is treated with scorn by such prints as the Tribune. We cannot see what was the use of sending a correspondent even as far as Baltimore.;;; A lie could have been concocted in the Tribune office just as well as in Barnum's Hotel.;;; We said a few days ago that the correspondent of the New York Times had uttered four distinct falsehoods with regard to the alleged disturbance.;;; First.;;; He said that the sheets on the Prince 's bed had been handled until they had been soiled.;;; That was a lie out of the whole cloth.;;; A number of visitors, before the arrival of the Prince, passed through his apartments and looked at the beds, but not one of them touched them, or anything on them, as the Messrs, Ballard can testify.;;; For twenty four hours before his arrival, the rooms were in charge of his own officer.;;; Secondly He said that the congregation of St. Paul's Church rose when he entered.;;; That this was an unalloyed falsehood, at least one thousand persons will testify -- that is to say, the whole congregation, including the clergyman who officiated.;;; Thirdly. He said that at Washington 's statue, the Prince was insulted by opprobrious allusions to the part his great-grandfather had adopted with regard to America.;;; The Mayor ( Mr. Mayo ) stood touching the Prince, and twenty other gentlemen stood near enough to hear anything that might have been said.;;; They all declare that not a syllable to which the Prince could take exception was uttered by any human being so far as they could hear.;;; The whole story was generated by the foul imagination of the Times' correspondent.;;; Fourthly. He said that the crowd at the Governor's House (or around it) was so disorderly, that the Prince was compelled to escape by a back entrance.;;; Governor Letcher, Mayor Mayo, Capt, Samuel Freeman, a number of gentlemen who were in the house, and at least two hundred persons outside, know that this was a falsehood.;;; We ourselves stood by the carriage and saw the Prince enter it with Mr. Mayo and the Duke of Newcastle.;;; It was drawn up at the front door.;;; Gov. Letcher stood at the door the Prince descended the steps with Mr. Mayo, and got into the carriage.;;; There was no back way by which he could have escaped into the street, if he had desired it, as anybody can see who will look at the premises.;;; If he had entered the carriage at a back door, he would have been compelled to drive around in front before he could get out. To these four distinct, positive falsehoods, we now add a fifth.;;; He stated that when the Prince arrived at his hotel, he was handled by the crowd in a very disagreeable fashion.;;; This is equally false with the other statements.;;; The crowd gave way for him wherever he approached, and not one of them touched so much as the hem of his garment.;;; The Herald tells us that the correspondents of the Tribune and London Times lied from Baltimore.;;; They simply fabricated falsehoods with regard to matters of which they could have no possible personal knowledge.;;; The correspondent of the New York Times was on the spot -- lied in the face of light and knowledge -- and is, therefore, so much the more a wilful calumniator.

TEXT: Sending back Bills.;;; There are two versions of a report touching the return of Northern bills sent to Columbia, South Carolina, for collection.;;; One of these represents simply that a meeting in that town had determined to return all bills sent there from the North for collection.;;; The other version is, that the lawyers of Columbia had determined to send back all of such bills sent to them for collection.;;; The latter is no doubt the correct statement of the proceeding, if there be truth in it at all. Now, we have no idea that the people of the South intend to avoid the debts they owe as long as they are able to pay them; and the people of South Carolina are as honest as those of any of the Southern States.;;; Indeed, it is a matter of doubt whether in a game of repudiation, the South would not lose more than the North; for the North is the commission merchant for the South, and holds an immense amount of unmatted bills for staple exports from the Southern States.;;; Honesty aside, it will be to the interest of North and South, in any event, that the debts due by one to the other shall be paid.;;; The question relative to the act of the lawyers, in declining to bring suit on bills sent to them to be collected under legal process, in the present state of the country, is a very different one.;;; It presents a subject for casuistry that will readily elicit a discussion among the profession. -- Whatever may be said of this, however, we are sure that the South will pay what it owes as readily and as honorably as the people of any portion of this Union.;;; We wish the Northern States were as ready to fulfill their Constitutional obligation, as the people of the South are to pay their honest debts.

The inference is irresistible that vessels are constantly sent to sea with hundreds of valuable lives on board, and yet charged with substances of the most subtle and powerful qualities, capable of causing the destruction of all on board.

TEXT: Supremacy of New York;;; It is a received idea in all parts of the Atlantic seaboard that New York is, commercially, impregnable, and when any great and comprehensive schemes of Southern development is suggested, the general answer is, that it's no use -- New York is the maelstrom which swallow up everything.;;; That it has not always been so, is matter of history; that it may not always be so hereafter, even intelligent New Yorkers admit to be possible.;;; The leading Internal Improvement men of New York admit that their city may lose its present commanding position.;;; They explicitly confess that a continuous water line to the Ohio would prove the most formidable rival that New York can encounter.;;; It is even admitted that the railroads of Pennsylvania and Maryland are beginning to affect the trade of New York.;;; An able and intelligent New York writer says@§@;;; "New York hitherto the undisputed commercial emporium of our continent, has learned that her valuated supremacy is not beyond the reach of her Southern rivals, Philadelphia and Haiti more.;;; Notwithstanding her magnificent harbor, nor immense wealth, her enterprise and thrift, facts have demonstrated the existence of elements of competition which have created new tendencies of trade, and which contribute to a formidable extent her supposed advantages.;;; Since the opening of the Pennsylvania, and Baltimore and Ohio railways, she has just felt a sensible diversion of her trade to those cities.;;; With the increased tactilities afforded by these new lines of communication, and the consequent reduction of the rates of transportation, they have been enacted to command a larger share of the Western business than at any former period.;;; In proportion as they have gained, New York has lost, and unless decisive measures be taken to overcome the inequality, her preponderance over her rivals will rapidly diminish.";;; Now, it is well known that neither of the railroads about whose competition New York manifests some apprehensions, have advantages to be compared with the great highways to the Atlantic which Virginia will present when the Covington and Ohio Railroad and the James River and Kanawha Canal are completed.;;; If a railroad as far north as Philadelphia, and another which has such heavy grades as the Baltimore and Ohio, neither of them possessing at the Atlantic terminus a harbor worthy of the name, can make an impression upon the New York Gibraltar, what may we not expect from such an improvement as the Covington and Ohio Railroad, with its easy grades and straight shoot to the heart of the Mississippi Valley, and from the James River and Kanawha Canal, with a capacity of transportation equal to that of sixteen railroads, and with every advantage over the Erie Canal, which has elevated New York to its present pitch of wealth and prosperity 1 There were many good patriots at the beginning of the American Revolution, who believed that it was the height of madness in infant and sparsely settled colonies, divided amongst themselves, having tory enemies at their own doors, threatened by numerous tribes of Indians, and having in their midst a large servile population, to throw off the political dominion of the most powerful empire of the world.;;; But there were others who thought differently, and resolved, at any rate, that they would Try. Only by encouraging a similar spirit, can we ever hope to shake off our commercial vassalage, and fulfill the destiny which nature seems to have marked out in the magnificent harbor of Norfolk, and the mighty streams which pour their waters into Chesapeake Bay.;;; It was by such a spirit that New York itself was built up from an inferior commercial position, and, in great measure, by the genius and energy of one man, Dewitt Clinton, who against her own absurd prejudices and stubborn opposition, succeeded at last in dragging her by the sheer force of his superior sagacity and will, into the construction of the New York and Erie Canal, and made her rich and great in spite of herself.;;; Would that Virginia could see her destiny; that she could believe in herself and in her fortunes!

TEXT: American character abroad.;;; A New York journal informs the public that the American character is losing ground in Europe, and that our Republic is no longer looked to with that ardor and hope which once arrayed it in the eyes of thousands as the land of promise.;;; The reasons of this change are briefly given.;;; Among them is an idea, every day gaining prevalence, that there is no security for human life here, that we are but little better than barbarians and outlaws.;;; This idea is founded on the deeds of violence and bloodshed which are so frequently recorded in the American papers.;;; Another reason of our waning popularity is, the abuse of the ballot box, which seems in many places to have fallen under the control of clubs of "muscle men," and to be deserted by those who have the most interest in the preservation of its purity, and are the most capable of directing the affairs of the country.;;; Still another source of disquietude to liberals abroad is our sectional divisions, which threaten to undermine our Government and involve us in all the horrors of civil war.

TEXT: Ingenious escape.;;; -- Fred Schulz, a life member, made his escape from the prison, on Monday night last, in the following ingenious manner@§@;;; On Monday he "layed up" in his cell, pretending to be sick, and in the evening, after dark, drilled a small hole, to admit a wire, in the lock of his door.;;; After the prisoner is locked in his cell for the night, the doors are further secured by a long heavy iron bar which runs the whole length of the tier of cells, and so arranged as to drop down over the top of each door and thus doubly secure it for the night — this bar is not, however, dropped down until about 8 o'clock, so that until that time the lock is the only security to prevent the prisoner from getting into the cell room.;;; After the prisoners have finished their evening meal an officer passes around the wards, and takes from each prisoner his dish and relocks the door, Schulz was on the first ward, and after the officer had taken his dish and passed on, he doubtless, drilled his hole in the lock and drew back the bolt; and as soon as the keeper had gone to the further end of the block and upon the second tier, ( Schulz being on the lower tier, and near the stairs, by which the corridors are reached,) he opened his door and passed rapidly up to the fourth tier, and on to the southwest octagon, the lock of which he picked — here his progress was stopped by a trap door, which led out to the battlements on the top — this door was well secured by a heavy iron bar and padlock, which, however, presented no obstruction to the ingenious mechanic — by-the-way, the best blacksmith in the prison, and who has done all the fine iron work in the institution.;;; Here he doubtless, however, remained until sometime in the night.;;; He then ascended, taking the iron bar with him, which he placed between the battlements, and fastened a rope he had prepared from his bedtick, and lowered himself down to the bars of the cell-room window, the grating of which furnished him a secure ladder for his descent into the prison yard, and the board fence in front of the prison was a difficulty readily overcome.;;; His escape was not discovered, of course, until breakfast in the morning, when the evidences of his leave-taking as above given were readily apparent.;;; Every effort has been made for his capture by the commissioner, but so far without effect. -- Waupin (Wis.)

Baker, Esq@§@;;; --My wife has been suffering with Dyspepsia and Nervous Affection for several years, during which time she was as ill as possible to be alive; all hopes of life, by her physician, as well as by her relatives and friends, were blasted.;;; Finally, she commenced, in small quantities, the use of Baker 's Premium Bitter, which, in the course of eight weeks, (by daily using them,) restored her to perfect health.;;; I am equally gratified to state that my child about eight years old, was long suffering with the Diarrh Œa, attended daily by an able physician, without giving any relief; but the use of one bottle of these Inestimable Bitters restored him entirely to health and vigor.;;; It is my firm opinion, substantiated by that of my family physician's, that Baker 's Premium Bitters is the best medicine now before the public for the above mentioned diseases. Yours, most truly, P. W. J. Quarles. These Bitters can be had of all the Druggists in this city, and at every respectable Drug Store in the State. Orders filled promptly by addressing E. Baker, Proprietor, oc 30 --ts Richmond, Va.
