TEXT: Further from South America.;;; American Affairs at Peru ----Terrible Accident----The Revolution in Bolivia, &amp;c.;;; The steamship Northern Light, which sailed from Aspinwall on the 25th ult., arrived at New York Friday morning, with $1,241,939 in gold.;;; Peru — Awful Accident.;;; The ultimatum (says the correspondent of the Panama Star ) of the Cabinet at Washington has been at last presented, and on Saturday evening, the Peruvian Government answered it, refusing to settle the following claims@§@--The Lizzie Thompson, Georgiana and Sartoria claim.;;; This last claim is one which no sensible person ever thought that the United States Government would even listen to, much less try and urge its payment; there can be but one term applied to it, and that is "infamous" The Peruvian Government have in its possession proofs against this claim of a most damning character, with some curious facts as to how such claims are made, but they are urged, and then the division of spoils.;;; The refusal to settle upon the terms demanded by the United States, necessarily compels Mr. Clay to demand his passport, haul down his flag and go home.;;; On Friday morning last the American ship Lucy M. Hale was discovered to be on fire.--The boats from the American vessels of war were immediately sent to her assistance, and it was by their praise worthy exertions that the vessel and cargo were saved.;;; To Captain Rudd, of the Lancaster, who, by his promptness on the occasion, too much praise cannot be awarded.;;; Yesterday a most frightful accident occurred in the Dry Dock at San Lorenzo, involving the entire loss of the Peruvian frigate Callao, (Apurimac) and almost the entire destruction of the dock, and a fearful loss of life.;;; The particulars of this lamentable affair are, as far as I can gather, as follows@§@ It having been deemed advisable to dock the ship in order to examine her copper and other trifling things, the Engineer of the dock was asked if she could be taken on with her battery, provisions and crew on board@§@ his opinion was that the dock could not raise her with that weight, consequently her guns were landed, yards sent down and top-gallant masts struck, retaining her provisions, magazine and crew on board, and in this state she entered the dock at 10 ½ A.M. There was a very large concourse of persons went over to witness the operation.--The Government steamer Ucayah conveyed the President, Minister of War, and a large number of invited guests.;;; Upon the arrival of the President the vessel began to enter the dock, and was soon placed in her proper position, the pumps were set to work — everything up to the present moment went well.;;; The keel of the frigate took the chocks of the platform, and she began to ascend out of the water.;;; Owing to her great depth of keel the chocks did not act as any support whatever on her bilge, therefore the ship was simply balanced upon her keel, and so long as she could be kept steady in that position she was safe, but her crew were on board, constantly moving from one side to the other, the ship being already top-heavy, this caused her to give one or two slight rolls, and then she pitched over on the starboard beam; at the second surge the three masts snapped about half-way up from the deck, her starboard ports being open, she rapidly filled with water, and here began a scene of horror impossible to describe.;;; The water was filled with men and women, wounded, dying, all screaming for help; boats were promptly sent to their assistance, or the loss of life would have been still more fearful.;;; Of the number that were below at the time very few escaped, and their cries for help were terrible, but that which was most heart-rending was the poor sick in the hospital, who, helpless with disease, could do naught but scream for that help that none could render them.;;; Up to the present time of writing it is not known how many have been lost, but it cannot fall short of one hundred and fifty.;;; The wounded that could be removed who did not require amputation were brought over to Callao, the rest remaining on the Island.--The number of broken heads, arms and legs is great.;;; Capt. Keer, of the English ship Golconda lowered his boats, and did good service in saving some thirty or forty lives.;;; The Callao was a fine 44 -gun frigate.;;; She is about six years old — the vessel is a total loss, being entirely under water; the dock may also be considered as done for, it having failed as a commercial speculation, and the present disaster may be considered as the last of the Callao Dry Dock.;;; Panama.;;; An official question has arisen between the United States and British naval forces in Panama, which is of considerable interest.;;; It has been occasioned by the order given to the guards from H. B. M.'s ship Clio, stationed at the British and French Consulates since the late riot, to hail all persons passing those houses.;;; Several foreigners have been stopped by the sentry, and on Saturday an American officer, and subsequently an American citizen, have been arrested for refusing to respond to the sentry, whilst passing through the public street.;;; The matter was brought before Flag officer Montgomery, in command of the U. S. naval forces, who at once addressed a communication to Capt. Miller, of H. B. M.'s ship Clio, on the subject, the result of which we have not yet heard, and until we do, we shall refrain from making any comments upon the proceeding.;;; Costa Rica.;;; Costa Rica is reported to be tranquil since the revolution.;;; From the other Central American States there is no news of interest.;;; Ecuador.;;; Guayaquil, Oct.13;;; --The people of Guayaquil having taken the strange step of making a kind of conditional " pronunciamento," in which document they stipulate for what they term Equality of Representation.;;; The Jefe Superior has banished from the public offices the paper money of the house of Luzarraga, to which Franco gave a forced circulation.;;; The recent destruction by fire of the residence of the Senoritas Carmanas, has drawn forth a decree calling for a small contribution for the purpose of purchasing two steam fire engines, for the purpose of protecting against these fires, from which Guayaquil is perpetually suffering.

TEXT: Chinese news.;;; --The New York Times ' correspondent at Shanghai furnishes interesting details of Chinese news to the 18th of August. The Allied fleet anchored a few miles from the mouth of the Pei-ho on the 30th of July, and the debarkation commenced on the 1st of August --the French securing the honor of first landing by jumping into the water and wading ashore.;;; The forts of the Peh-tang village, having been previously abandoned by the Chinese, were occupied by the Allies next day. The position of the Chinese on the Pei-ho river is represented to be a very strong one, and, in addition to these fortifications, they have two bodies of troops, one numbering 10,000, and the other from 40,000 to 50,000.;;; It was expected that the attack would certainly be made on the 12th or 13th, as a longer delay might result in a great deal of sickness, from the malaria of the marshes.;;; Mr. Ward, our Minister, was with the Allied fleet, as was our entire naval force on the station.;;; This fact gave great dissatisfaction to the American residents of Shanghai, who could not see the necessity of two American war steamers at the Pei-ho, especially when Shanghai was threatened by a rebel force of 20,000, which was reported to be only four miles off. The whole available force in the city to defend it was only about 1,500 men.

TEXT: Singular case of poisoning by a boy.;;; A remarkable case of attempted murder by poison has occurred lately, as we learn from the Burlington Free Press, at Montpelier, Vt. A little child of Hon. C. W. Willard, while drinking his milk, was seized with violent vomiting.;;; The milk was examined and found to contain corrosive sublimate enough to kill a dozen men. The poison had evidently been put into the milk after it had been poured into the child's cup, and the sudden violent reaction of the child's stomach was all that saved its life.;;; The wonder was, who could have done it — for the servants, a girl, and an Irish boy named John Roakes, were considered trusty, and were both exceedingly fond of the child.;;; Finally suspicion fell upon Roakes, who confessed that he put the poison in the child's cup, not from any ill will to Mr. and Mrs. W., who had always treated him kindly, or to the baby, but simply from hatred to the servant girl, with whom he had some trivial quarrel, and on whom he hoped the suspicion of committing the crime would fall.;;; He also owned to having taken and destroyed, by burning them, some valuable articles of clothing, which had disappeared from time to time, expecting that the girl would be charged with the theft.;;; He was immediately arraigned before the Court in session at the time, plead guilty, and was sentenced to eight years imprisonment.

HEADER: Thackeray's George IV.
TEXT: Thackeray 's George IV.;;; Thirty-eight years ago, when George IV. was but a new King, upon the occasion of his visit to Ireland, Byron wrote@§@ "Spread — spread for Vitellius the royal repast, Till the gluttonous despot be stuffed to the gorge.;;; And the roar of his drunkards proclaims him, at last.;;; The Fourth of the fools and oppressors called George. ";;; Bitter as this language is — exceeded in bitterness only by what precedes and follows it in the same poem — posterity has endorsed the judgment pronounced upon the royal glutton by the indignant bard.;;; Mr. Thackeray is the last who has spoken, and the only difference between the contemporary satirist and the essayist of the present day, is, that the former attacks the living monarch with the stern indignation of a patriot, while the latter treats the dead King as a fit subject for no sentiment stronger than derision.;;; All the laughing devils under Mr. Thackeray 's control — and their name is legion — are let loose upon the memory of the dead voluptuary.;;; "To make a portrait of him," he says, "at first seemed a matter of small difficulty.;;; There is his coat, his star, his wig, his countenance simpering under it; with a slate and a piece of chalk, I could at this very desk perform a recognizable likeness of him. And yet, after reading of him in scores of volumes, hunting him through old magazines and newspapers; having him here at a ball, there at races, and so forth, you find you have nothing — nothing but a coat and wig, and a mask smiling below it — nothing but a great simulacrum.--His sire and grandsire were men. One knows what they were like; what they would do in given circumstances; that on occasion they fought, and demeaned themselves like tough, good soldiers.;;; They had friends whom they liked according to their natures; enemies whom they hated fiercely; passions, and actions, and individualities of their own. The sailor King who came after George was a man; the Duke of York was a man, big, burly, loud, jolly, cursing, courageous.;;; But this George what was he?;;; I look through all his life and recognize but a bow and a grin.--I try and take him to pieces, and I find silk stockings, padding, stays, a coat with frogs and a fur collar, a star and blue ribbon, a pocket-handkerchief prodigiously scented, one of Truefitt 's best nutty-brown wigs reeking with oil, a set of teeth and a huge black stock, under-waistcoats, more under-waistcoats, and then nothing.;;; I know of no sentiment that he ever distinctly uttered.;;; Documents are published under his name, but people wrote them --private letters, but people spelled them.;;; He put a great George P. or George R. at the bottom of the page, and fancied he had written the paper.;;; Some bookseller's clerk, some poor author, some man did the work; saw to the spelling; cleaned up the slovenly sentences, and gave the lax, maudlin, slipslop a sort of consistency.;;; He must have had an individuality; the dancing master whom he emulated, nay, surpassed — the wig-maker who curled his toupee for him — the tailor who cut his coats, had that.;;; But, about George, one can get at nothing actual.;;; The outside, I am certain, is pad and tailor's work; there may be something behind, but what?;;; We cannot get at the character; no doubt never shall.;;; Will men of the future have nothing better to do, than to unswathe and interpret that royal old mummy?;;; I own I once used to think it would be good sport to pursue him, fasten on him, and pull him down.;;; But now I am ashamed to mount and lay good dogs on, to summon a full field, and then to hunt the poor game.";;; And yet this poor creature had among his friends and intimates some of the most distinguished men of his day, while he was still but Prince of Wales, and had not even assumed the reins as Regent.;;; Heartless and treacherous as he was known to be, utterly destitute of all principle, and profligate to a degree too scandalous even to be alluded to, he had not only such men as Burke, Pitt and Sheridan among his friends, but even such as Wilberforce and Sir Walter Scott. Cringing was the besetting weakness of the last, and his abject flattery of George IV. leaves a blot upon his memory which it is painful to all men to contemplate.;;; Well do we recollect the feeling of contemptuous indignation with which his admirers read of his conduct in the newspapers, when George IV. visited Edinburgh — how the monarch drank his health — how he took the glass and put it in his pocket, declaring that it should be transmitted to his latest posterity — and how he sat down upon it and crushed it, to the infinite amusement of everybody but himself, and to the serious danger of the sitting portion of his body.;;; They held down their heads in silence, or vented their indignation in curses — for their ideal of the man was formed upon the model which he had himself furnished in the numerous characters he had drawn.;;; Nevertheless, it is but proper to say, that in his own person, Scott was a man of sterling independence.;;; He asked nobody to give him anything for which he was not willing to work.;;; He asked favors of no man, least of all of the King.;;; He would be silent for a whole evening, if the merest numskull of a peer chanced to be of the company, but he would not consent to be patronized by any peer that ever existed.;;; The peculiar turn of Scott 's mind brought him to his knees whenever a nobleman was present.;;; That accounts for his subserviency.;;; But how to account for Fox and Sheridan! There lies the difficulty.;;; Perhaps it was to be found in the personal fascinations of the man; for that he possessed great powers of entertaining his friends, in his younger days, is incontestable, in spite of all Byron and Thackeray have said.;;; Among other talents, Raikes tells us, upon the authority of the Duke of Wellington, that he possessed the power of mimicry in an almost unequaled degree, and though this is a very low, still it is a very entertaining talent.;;; But besides, he was the best raconteur of his day, and his budget of anecdotes was uncommonly large.;;; In the course of this lecture, Mr. Thackeray alludes to a well known circumstance in the life of George IV., upon which Raikes, on the authority, we believe, of Sir Henry Halford, is much more explicit.;;; He was certainly deranged — as mad as his father had been — during the greater part of the last years of his life.;;; When in this situation he fancied that he had personally commanded in all the campaigns of the Peninsula — in other words, had filled the place of Wellington --and actually related anecdotes of battles, sieges, and marches, as of events that occurred under his own eye. His ministers kept the secret from the world and reigned for him, as Pitt had done for his father.;;; Mr. Thackeray does not allude to his general madness, but contents himself with alleging a sort of monomania.;;; He says@§@ "I believe it is certain about George IV. that he had heard so much of the war, knighted so many people, and worn such a prodigious quantity of Marshal 's uniforms, cocked hats, cock's feathers, and scarlet and bullion in general, that he actually fancied he had been present in some campaigns, and, under the name of Gen. Brock, led a tremendous charge of the German legion at Waterloo."

HEADER: Mexico.
TEXT: Mexico.;;; It is remarked, with truth, by the New Orleans Picayune, that the soil of Mexico has drunk up the best blood of its people, and the country is scarcely more populous to-day than it was when it threw off the Spanish yoke.--In Central America, civil war is the rule, and peace is the exception.;;; In South America, the bloody role of Revolution is acted with a dreary and horrible monotony.;;; These statements of our New Orleans contemporary are the literal historical truth; and why, we would ask, is it so?;;; Why? The Constitutions of the Southern Republics are almost exact transcripts of our own; they have all the forms of liberty and law, but the spirit is dead, if indeed it ever existed.;;; It is not in free Constitutions to create freemen; the Constitution must be the product of the character, genius and customs of a race, or it will perish as soon as born.;;; Our Anglo- Saxon race has been trained for centuries in the principles and practice of self-government, and it is this training, not the free forms — which have grown out of it, and are but the symbol of the inward life — which has given success thus far to our grand experiment of Liberty and Law. What reflecting man can look at the eternal and bloody conflicts of Mexico, Central and South America; at the national impoverishment and degradation of the whole continent, with the exception of the great monarchy of Brazil, and imagine that political equality is alike a blessing to men of all nations, or that the capacity of self-government can be conveyed by the adoption of constitutional forms?;;; Republican institutions are no more fit for all people, than the same coat is fit for all backs, as the repeated trials and repeated failures in Europe have often proved, and will prove again as often as they are attempted.;;; The condition of Mexico is every day becoming worse and worse, instead of better.--Civil war rages through the whole length and breadth of that unhappy country, dividing cities, towns, villages, and even families, exhibiting the horrible spectacle sometimes of father and son arrayed in battle against each other, and brother shedding the blood of brother.;;; Deeds of cruelty are occasionally perpetrated by the military commanders, which make the blood run cold.;;; It is reported that Gen. Miramon has lately whipped to death a woman, and that woman in a situation which the most brutal generally respect, for the offence of endeavoring to effect the escape of her husband from prison.;;; If this be true, no vengeance could be too great for such a monster; yet such are the furious passions always engendered by civil war. As brethren offended are the most bitter of all enemies, so civil war is the most merciless and vindictive of all contests.;;; To that more than to any other kind of hostilities, apply the words of the dramatist-- "Imitate the action of the tiger; Stiffen the sinews; summon up the blood.";;; War, in its best aspect, is full of horrors unspeakable, and presents a lively image of the crimes and miseries of the infernal pit; but it has its glories and its consolations when undertaken in a just cause against a foreign foe. But civil wars, like those in which Mexico is now engaged, benefit nobody but political and military adventurers, brigands and burglars; its battles establish no principle and produce no fruits, except the weeds, thorns and briars which mark its crimson path; its victories are victories over itself; its garlands are wet with fraternal blood, and its battle stains smell of murder.;;; May Heaven avert from this country such a catastrophe!

A few more years of dissolving scenes O'er the magic lamp will pass, And childhood's smile will be mellowed then, In the calm of maturer years, And off the light in those eyes of blue Be darkened, by sorrow's tears, A few more years, and that yielding trust Be lost in a maze of fears.;;; That trusting love which is now all ours.;;; We may yet unto others resign -- But, oh!;;; if the oak extends its arms, Where the ivy may climb and twine, Their after years may yet be blest, May be bright, indeed, as mine.

HEADER: The Art of Fighting the French Army.
TEXT: The Art of Fighting the French Army.;;; Prince Frederick Charles, of Prussia, has just published a pamphlet, under the title of The Art of Fighting the French Army. The royal author gives as the first principle of the French system of warfare, that the French soldier always marches forward; the second, he says, is, that moral is superior to physical force.;;; So Marshal Canrobert, when he had a coup de main on his hands in the Crimea, always asked his soldiers@§@ "Do you feel equal to it?" They never answered "No;" and the promise which they themselves had given to their General was the guarantee of their success.;;; The third principle of the French, according to the Prince, is to hold themselves in a serried column against an enemy which is badly disciplined and unaccustomed to military manŒavres; and, on the contrary, to fight with disordered ranks and like skirmishers when they have to do with regular and well-disciplined troops.;;; The fourth French principle is, never to defend themselves passively.;;; Of this the Prince says@§@ "If it happens that the French are attacked by a close column, they proceed in this way, and it is especially excellent when the attack is not supported by a corps de reservé. The French riflemen gave way at the point of attack; the attacking column, imagining that this is the commencement of a retreat, pushes on; but soon the riflemen present a new front -- one or two columns advance.;;; The sharp-shooters surround the enemy on all sides; he hesitates; he loses time; he cannot turn back; there he is compelled to fight, and is abandoned to his fate.;;; The French soldiers are ordered in this case not to kill any more, but to make prisoners, because a soldier can take five or six prisoners in the time required to kill one man.";;; "It is a principle," says the Prince, "in the French army that an attack, when once resolved upon, can never be executed too soon or too rapidly.;;; In Italy, fire seldom lasted a quarter of an hour before they came to the bayonet, and oftentimes they did not burn a cartridge during the attack.;;; It appears, now, that the French attack at a full run, to which they exercised during peace, so that, when they reach the enemy, they are not out of breath." The Prince claims many of these principles as of Prussian origin.;;; He believes that they are not even the product of the French national character, and that the temperament of the Prussian soldiers is admirably adapted to their adoption.;;; In conclusion, he proposes -- first, to employ riflemen by columns of one company each; second, to dispose the army in depth rather than in breadth, which increases the power of resistance on the flanks, and prevents a rapid loss of men; and thirdly, the disposition of an army as much as possible like the squares on a chess-board, which is the best means of sustaining the impetuous attack of such troops as the Zouaves and Turcos made on a full run with the bayonet.;;; The Prince 's last sentence is -- "May we consider these principles while there is yet time. ";;; Life Insurance, &amp;c.
