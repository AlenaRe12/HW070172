All was dark, but a noise on the stairway told him that some one was not standing but moving, and he aimed the gun down the stairs and fired.;;; Almost immediately he heard the noise of something falling over in the parlor, and running to the window saw a man running away through the woods.;;; He then struck a light and went down stairs.;;; The door which opened at the foot of the stairs was perforated with the shot, and in the parlor was everything of any value in the house tied in bundles ready for removal.;;; All the clothes, silver, linen, cutlery, and every thing moveable, had been packed up in parcels.

The cupola of the City Hotel was also blown down by the gale.-- New Haven Journal, Nov. 5.

TEXT: A Woman of Genius.;;; -- Many years ago, Miss Charlotte Cushman was doing, at the Park Theatre, what in stage parlance is called general utility — the work of three ordinary performers; filling the gap when any one was sick; playing Mr. Richings ' parts if he was away; playing Mr. Chippendale 's parts if he could not, or would not do so; playing Mrs. Chippendale 's parts on occasion,--never refusing to do what was allotted to her. As may be supposed, one who held this position had as yet no position to be proud of. One night, " Guy Mannering," a musical piece, was announced; it was produced for Mr. Braham, the great tenor who played Harry Bertram.-- Mrs. Chippendale was cast for Meg Merrilles, but, during the day, was taken ill; so this obscure utility actress, this Miss Cushman, was sent for, and told to be ready in the part by night.;;; She might read it on the boards if she could not commit it. But the "utility woman" was not used to reading her parts; she learned it before nightfall, and played it after nightfall.;;; She played it so as to be enthusiastically applauded, and so as to have Mr. Braham say to her, "I have performed in this piece with all the cleverest women who could be cast for Meg Merrilles, but you are the first who has manifested any appreciation of the character; you played it admirably." At this half day's notice, the part was taken up, which now is so famous among dramatic portraitures; and this sudden performance of the unknown utility woman was the first step in that career which culminates now so splendidly.-- N.

Our city readers are familiar with those used in the Governor 's Guard, and we allude more especially to the horses ridden by the troopers from neighboring counties.;;; They are well trained and spirited, and many of them really graceful and elegant in their movements.;;; A trip to the Camp is simply compensated for in the view of this large collection of fine animals.;;; The Chesterfield Company and the Powhatan Troop, attended by Col.

HEADER: The Presidential election.
TEXT: The Presidential election.;;; It is at least a matter of congratulation that the painful and lamentable Presidential canvass just concluded has come to an end. When we looked to the North we found a party organized upon a sentiment of hostility to the social system of the South, and sustaining a nominee for the first office in the Union upon the one idea of uncompromising war upon Southern rights.;;; Among the partisans of that nominee was an immense body of men who were disciplined and drilled as soldiers, and bore the name of John Brown 's Kansas band of fanatics, cut-throats and horse-stealers — viz@§@ "Wide Awakes." Every incident of the campaign of this furious and fanatical party, led on by the arch-traitor Seward and his confederates, was indicative of hatred and vindictiveness towards the South.;;; All sense of obligation to the Constitution and the laws,--all the feelings of reciprocal affection between the people of the North and the South, as descendents alike of ancestors who perilled their blood and treasure for the rights and liberties we enjoy — all regard for the ties of sympathy and interest, the policy of the common defence and general welfare on which the Union itself was founded under an agreement of the sovereign States--were utterly ignored and the wild fury of party and determination to seize power and the perquisites of office by banding together every element of hostility to the South, ruled the hour, and reason and right gave way to the mere will of numerical power.;;; When we turned to the South we beheld a scene of discord without precedent in its history.;;; The several parties arrayed there against one another were bitter in their denunciations of each other, and active in the raising and pressing of issues that were untimely and injurious in their effects.;;; Altercation of the most unprofitable character was freely indulged; and never before was there in the South so much public speaking in a Presidential canvass, and never to so little profit and benefit.;;; We may say never so much to the general injury and disadvantage of the Southern people.;;; Nothing could be more grateful to the common enemy, whose drilled cohorts were steadily marching to victory.;;; The arch-fiend of the infernal regions could not gloat with more pleasurable emotions over a fend in Paradise, than did the partisans of Lincoln over the idle internal war among Southern politicians and their passionate followers.;;; These scenes and this unprofitable struggle have come to an end. Lans deo! We have in exchange for the dread of an event, the event itself.;;; Lincoln Is Elected! It is much more grateful to a manly sensibility to be striving with fortitude to repair the injuries of a calamity than to be fearfully contemplating one that we know not how to avert.;;; We can now take time to consider.;;; Inexperienced and hot-headed young gentlemen who have intemperately and recklessly pressed impracticable issues may now have leisure to reflect and draw lessons of wisdom, we hope from the errors which they have committed.;;; Elder gentlemen, somewhat waspish and exasperated, whose lives have brought them more grey hairs than discretion, may, for awhile, occupy themselves in the same profitable self-examination, though we fear not with the same chances of benefit that are enjoyed by their younger contemporaries.;;; The election of Abraham Lincoln has indeed put this country in peril.;;; With him comes that calamity which Washington dreaded as a wedge that would assuredly split the Union in twain, viz@§@ a sectional party in one division of the Union founded on issues hostile to the people of the other, seizing the reins of government and dictating rulers to the nation.;;; He saw in this an outrage, an alienation of the affection and sympathies of the States, which, sooner or later, would dissolve the Union.;;; He was right.;;; It can only be a question of time.;;; Two people who are thus led to hate one another, and struggle against each other, cannot long continue to live together under the same Government.;;; Mr. Fillmore, who has filled the seat first occupied by Washington, pronounced the triumph of the sectional party at the North a sufficient cause for the secession of the Southern States from the Union, and when he carried the argument home to his fellow-citizens of New York by asking them whether they would submit if the South, having the power, were to say that none but slaveholders should hold the office of President, and should proceed to fill the Presidential chair alone with such men — the unanimous response was "no!" And rightly; for that would be an exercise of tyranny that make submission a state of vassalage.;;; Yet while we consider the continuation of the Black Republican crusade against the South as incompatible with the existence of the Union, we trust that the South will forbear at this time to take any extreme measure.;;; Not that we wait for an "overt act." We do not "wait for a sign.";;; The outrage perpetrated is great, and cannot be wiped out by the failure of Lincoln to commit an "overt act.";;; But there are reasons why we should wait and try to preserve this powerful union of States, in spite of fanaticism and the unchivalrous and unscrupulous, and the low and depraved instincts which govern the great body of the leaders of the Black Republican party at the North.;;; It is at least a reasonable conjecture that Lincoln owes his elevation to the Presidency to the divisions and discords of those who are opposed to him and his party.;;; Those whose delinquency we may thus rationally conclude has produced this deplorable result, ought not to break up the Union for their own fault.--Besides, we of the South see at the North an immense body of faithful citizens, who constitute large minorities in every Black Republican State, who have struggled with unfaltering constancy against the baleful power of the party which hangs like a black cloud over the fate of the nation.;;; They have been true to the Constitution and to their fellow-citizens of the South.;;; Ought we not, for their sakes — who have been true where if costs something to be true — to wait and struggle with them a while longer, trusting that they may yet rule the North through accessions to their ranks from the sober second thought of masses of misled honest mer., who have followed the delusive lights of the fanatics and the unprincipled demagogues who direct the fell agitation in the free States?-- May we not argue that this would be wise and considerate, and that the South may with justice to herself pursue this course?;;; May we not hope that in four years, by calmly awaiting events, a great revolution may take place in public sentiment at the North, and we shall again have national parties predominating there which shall be in correspondence and sympathy with the same parties at the South, and that the harmony and fraternal regard of the two divisions of the Union will be happily restored?;;; Let us at least hope that it will, and that this Union is destined, in spite of the gross aberration of the public mind at the North, to endure through a cycle of time bearing at least some respectable comparison to the duration of the more powerful nations of the world.

TEXT: Wine in America.;;; It is evident that the culture of the grape in this country, and the manufacture and traffic in American wines, are destined to become one of our prominent interests.;;; It originated in Cincinnati through the enterprise and public spirit of one of its citizens, who not only imported his original grape vines from France, but also obtained from that country vine cultivators and dressers, and a number of men who were perfectly conversant with the manufacture of champagne.;;; A gentleman who has lately visited Cincinnati gives an interesting account in the Philadelphia American of the result of his observations of the wine manufacture.;;; He found in the vaults of the principal wine manufacturer in that city 250,000 bottles of American champagne, as the "Sparkling Catawba " is designated, that were old, ripe and ready for export; also, about 100,000 gallons in casks, one of which contained nearly 5,000 --all fit, either for "still" or sparking Catawba.;;; The crop of grapes in the neighborhood of Cincinnati last year produced one million gallons of wine.;;; The crop of 1858 yielded one million and a half.;;; Every bushel of grapes weighing sixty pounds makes four gallons of wine.;;; The sparking wine is kept about eighteen months prior to sale, and the still wine two and a half years. The greatest drawback in the trade, is the bursting of bottles, from the inexperience of the bottlers and cellar men. It is believed that, in a few years, three millions and a half of gallons of wine will be manufactured in this country.;;; The writer says that in every degree of latitude within the United States grapes may be grown to perfection, and, as different sorts are successively introduced, so will varieties of wine prevail.;;; If we have the proper soils — the climate is said to be all that can be desired — clarets, ports and sherries will become home products.;;; Should an era of cheap wines be inaugurated in this country, the vice of intoxication will probably diminish.;;; On this subject, an experienced gentleman in the wine culture of Cincinnati stated that the quantity of harder spirits consumed annually in Russia was 24,000,000 of gallons — that the amount produced from wine lees in France was about the same — and that the exportable quantity produced in America was similar.;;; This information was elicited by the interrogatory, as to whether much whiskey was exported from this country to France, to be made into a spurious brandy.;;; He said that the statistics he had given would show that it would not pay — the ardent distilled from lees of wine being cheaper.--True, one or two experiments had been made with success, but that was during a scarcity of the grape crop in France — that even then they did not compensate, and that now they would prove a certain loss.;;; Therefore, no whiskey whatever is now exported to France to be converted into brandy.;;; From 1,500 to 2,000 gallons of whiskey are brought into Cincinnati daily, some of which would "kill at twenty yards."

Yet a long period elapsed before any measures were adopted to coerce this refractory and reprobate territory, and when an army at last was sent, Peace Commissioners were sent with it who tied up its hands and prevented it from using the weapons with which it was provided.;;; The country has stood by and seen Brigham Young come successfully out of his conflict with the federal government, and made no complaints of the manner in which its authority has been set at naught, so opposed is the public sentiment of the United States to compulsory measures and to shedding blood in vindication of its authority.

The Italians, do not, like the French, appreciate this delicate mode of promoting the public interests, and accordingly raised such a clamor about the ears of Dumas, that he was glad to retire once more to that post of honor, a private station.;;; During the brief reign of the Reds, ten years ago, in Paris, they made hay while the sun shone, and kept up a degree of state quite unknown in the days of the Citizen King.;;; Ledru Rollin had more horses and carriages, all at the public cost, than were maintained by Louis Phillipe and all the royal family.

TEXT: Fortifications vs. Ships.;;; A memorable admission was made by Lord Palmerston in urging the necessity of a system of fortifications for the defence of England.;;; He said that the Baltic fleet, the largest and most powerful which England ever sent to sea, did not dare to attack Cronstadt.;;; The fortifications of that position were so strong as to prevent Sir Charles Napier, with the most magnificent squadron which the world has ever seen, manned by the flower of the English navy, from firing a single gun at the Russian Gibraltar.

TEXT: From Richmond to Hampton in a balloon.;;; -- Professor Wells left Richmond in his balloon, Mt. Vernon, on Saturday evening last, at a quarter before 4 o'clock, and at 6 o'clock landed on Mr. Henry Smith 's farm, near Hampton, thus making the distance of 90 miles in two hours and a quarter.;;; The Norfolk Day Book says@§@;;; This is the largest balloon trip on record in this State, and places the Professor a long way ahead of all his local contemporaries.;;; On the passage from Richmond he made two ineffectual attempts to land, but each time fell in James river.;;; The last time his basket upset and he lost all his ballast.;;; The balloon being now freed of considerable weight, shot up about three miles, where the atmosphere was so cold as to almost give the Professor a chill.;;; At this altitude the gas was so expanded that it rushed through the neck of the balloon and escaped, thus causing the serial ship to fall as rapidly as he had gone up. On the approach to the earth a strong current of wind, rushing at the rate of a mile a minute, caught him, and in three or four minutes more would have carried him over to the very centre of the Chesapeake Bay; fortunately, however, he was enabled to grapple to a pine tree on the farm above mentioned, where he left his balloon floating in the air until next morning, when, with the kind assistance of Mr. Smith, he pulled it down.;;; The Professor thinks of getting up an excursion from this place back to Richmond, and is of the opinion that if he can strike the proper current he can reach Richmond in two hours. He is a daring and skillful serial voyager, and deserves success.;;; The returns

Mr. Bonham was persuaded, and made a speech in favor of arming the State.;;; He said@§@;;; "Let the State be armed.;;; The amount of money is a matter of no consequence on such as occasion.;;; Let the State be thoroughly armed.;;; Let all the necessary steps be taken, sad without any threats, let it be announced that the fourth of March will not dawn upon South Carolina as a member of this Confederacy.;;; Their own intelligence showed them what would be the result if a Black Republican President was to fill every post-office with one of his own minions.;;; The true men of the South desire that the South should act in concert.--Whilst he did not desire to precipitate the issue, yet, at the same time, we should not postpone the day until Lincoln is inaugurated and his agents put into the post-office.;;; If our own citizens refuse, Lincoln will put in some others.;;; If they take office under him, it would not be long before they would have a party formed against us. For himself, he would allow no power — and no power but that of the sword could ever inaugurate a Black Republican minion of Lincoln 's in South Carolina.;;; This, he believed, would be the prevailing sentiment.;;; He had observed that the Governor of Alabama had said that it is not his duty to call a Convention of the people until some time in December.;;; "He thought it to be regretted that State did not take the lead, there were so many demagogues throughout the country who seize upon the action of South Carolina to create clamor against her. Alabama, in his judgement, ought to take a steady step forward.;;; But South Carolina must not wait.;;; They should call a Convention of the people at an early day. Put the State in the attitude of defence.;;; We should be prepared to defend our action, if necessary, at the point of the bayonet.;;; If other States act with us, so much the better, if not in the first instance, he would, with the distinguished Senator who had just addressed them, raise the Palmetto Flag, and fling it to the breeze.;;; He believed now, as he always believed, that if South Carolina goes the other Southern States will follow.;;; He had no hope of maintaining our rights in the present Confederacy.;;; They had no safety but in dissolution.;;; If no other State moves, in conclusion, he would say, let us take South Carolina out before the 4th of March.";;; Hon. Wm. C. Boyce, in his speech on the same night, said@§@;;; "In my opinion, the South ought not to submit.;;; If you intend to resist, the way to resist in earnest is to act; the way to enact revolution, is to stare it in the face.;;; I think the only policy for us is to arm as soon as we receive authentic intelligence of the election of Lincoln.;;; It is for South Carolina, in the quickest manner, and by the most direct means, to withdraw from this Union.;;; Then we will not submit, whether the other Southern States will act with us or our enemies.--They cannot take sides with our enemies; they must take sides with us.";;; Efforts were made in the Legislature yesterday to wait for the co-operation of the other Southern States, but failed.;;; A State Convention will be called, and secession is certain.--The election of delegates will probably be ordered on the 4th of December, and the Convention will meet on the 17th.;;; Messrs. Boyce, Benham and Keitt urge the call of a Convention and immediate action.;;; Charleston, Nov. 8.;;; --A large body of citizens called on the resigning Federal officials last night with cheering demonstrations.;;; The ex-officials returned thanks in spirited addresses.;;; A dispatch in the Courier from Washington says Mr. Buchanan will resist nullification, but not secession.;;; Milledgeville, Ga., Nov. 8.;;; -- Gov. Brown, in a special message to the Georgia Legislature, thinks that few States will meet in a Southern Convention, and does not recommend the appointment of delegates from Georgia to one.;;; He thinks the Constitutional rights of the people of Georgia have been violated by several of the non-slaveholding States to an extent justifying, in the judgment of civilized nations, the adoption of any measures for their restoration and future protection.;;; He refers to the patriotic spirit or the origin of our Government, and then recounts the unconstitutional and unfriendly legislation of many of the Northern States.;;; He is particularly severe on Massachusetts, and thinks, as the laws of that State sanction the robbery of Southern States, her citizens should be compelled to compensate us. He advises reprisals, and says we should meet illegal and unfriendly legislation with just retaliation.;;; He recommends the passage of laws authorizing the seizure of such amounts of money and property belonging to the citizens of the offending and faithless States as shall constitute an indemnification to the citizens of Georgia for their losses.;;; Also, legislation to drive the manufactured articles of such offending States from Georgia.;;; As Georgia has the right, as soon as Northern goods are introduced within her limits, to tax them as she deems proper, she should pass a law, taking effect after the 1st of January, taxing goods 25 per cent., if brought from Massachusetts, Vermont, Michigan, Maine, Rhode Island, New York, Wisconsin and other unfriendly States, the tax to be remitted when unfriendly legislation is repealed.;;; Should such legislation be ineffectual, she should repeal all parts of the penal and civil code protecting the lives and properties and liberties of these States where such unfriendly laws shall exist.;;; In his opinion, the time for bold and decided action had come — and he would be unworthy of the confidence of the people of Georgia who refuses to vindicate her honor at every cost and maintain her Constitutional rights at any hazard.;;; The legislation recommended will, he thinks, lend rather to strengthen than weaken the Union, as it will destroy the sectional issue and narrow the issue down to a contest between individual States.;;; It the Legislature fails to enact laws, the people should rise in their right, and at the ballot-box demand, their enactment.;;; Every State has a right to act for herself, and as long as all the States abide in good faith by their Constitutional obligations, no one State could withdraw from the Confederacy without being guilty of bad faith to the others; but any violation of the compact relieves all the parties from their obligations.;;; The right of secession, for cause, is only denied by those who deny the sovereignty of States.;;; The message occupies twenty-two closely printed octavo pages, and contains a full review of existing offensive Northern legislation.;;; It concludes thus@§@;;; "For the purpose of putting the State in a defensive condition as fast as possible, and preparing for any emergency which must be met, sooner or later, I recommend that the sum of $1,000,000 be immediately appropriated as a military fund for the ensuing year, and that prompt provision be made for raising such portion of the money as may not be in the public treasury as fast as the public needs require its expenditure. ' Millions for defence — not one cent for tribute,' should be the future motto of the Southern States.;;; To every demand for further concession or compromise of our rights we should reply, 'The argument is exhausted, and we low stand on our arms.";;; Charleston, Nov. 8.;;; --In addition to the other Federal officers here who have resigned, Mr. Jacobs, Deputy Collector of the port, had notified the President of his resignation.;;; All the officers of the United States government in this city intend resigning on the inauguration of Lincoln.;;; Washington, Nov. 8.;;; --The Administration continues to be privately advised of the condition of affairs at the South.;;; There has been no formal consideration of the subject in the Cabinet, and consequently no course of action is determined on. It is known that there is a difference of opinion among the members of the Cabinet on the distinctive legal question of succession; but this does not involve the resignation of any of them.;;; It is not contemplated to send additional troops to Southern military posts.;;; Savannah, Ga., Nov. 8.;;; --A mass meeting, the largest ever assembled in this city, was held here to-night.;;; Eloquent speeches were made, and resolutions unanimously adopted declaring that the election of Lincoln ought not to be submitted; to asking the Legislature to communicate that opinion to the representatives of Georgia in Congress, and co-operate with the Governor in calling a State Convention to determine on the mode and manner of redress; recommending the Legislature to pass such laws as will alleviate the very unusual commercial embarrassments consequent on the present political emergency, and to take immediate steps to organize an armed force in the State.;;; A colonial flag was raised this afternoon on Green 's monument, in the presence of an immense multitude.;;; Several speeches were made.;;; Great excitement prevails here, and a large number of Minute Men have been enrolled.
