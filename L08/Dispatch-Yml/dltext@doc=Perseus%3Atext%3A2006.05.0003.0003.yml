HEADER: English view of the late Royal visit.
TEXT: English view of the late Royal visit.;;; The London Post has an interesting article on the visit of the Prince to the United States, which undoubtedly represents fairly the sentiments of the masses in England towards this country.;;; We have selected portions of the article as follows@§@;;; "Time has healed all the wounds contracted in the war of independence, and the Americans, who, after all, are really fond of England, are glad to have an opportunity of showing friendship, respect, and hospitality to this country's future king.;;; That our Prince of Wales should have been received in the country which calls itself the headquarters of Republican Government, is only another instance of what surprising things some men may live to see. There are men living who can remember the heartburning and bitterness that followed the American war, when the very name of king and the very idea of monarchy was scarcely mentioned without expressions of contempt.;;; Those feelings have passed away, and in their stead have come a warm and outspoken regard not only for English people, but for English princes.";;; "The son and heir of Queen Victoria, though traveling in a private capacity, is welcomed and feted along every inch of his journey.;;; all press to look at him, all are proud of his coming, and wish him to carry away only pleasant and affectionate recollections of a markable tour.;;; Such a visit is a great epoch in the young Prince 's life, the recollections of which can never fade from his memory.;;; He may visit Canada and the States again before he is King of England, and be as well received; he may see India and other portions of his mother's vast dominions, and wherever he goes he will be honored with the loyalty and love of his mother's subjects; but nothing, one would think, will ever equal in depth, clearness and freshness, the impressions of this first transatlantic trip.;;; But it is scarcely less an epoch in the history of the United States.;;; It is a middle point between two eras.;;; The old will compare the public feeling now displayed with what they knew in their youth; the young will recount it in years to come as a great event to date from.";;; "What a past is that which the history of the United States presents!;;; What a growth!;;; What a progress from the disadvantages of a distant and ill-governed colony to all the strength and influence of a great nation!;;; To its fertile soil men have flocked from all parts of the world, and been absorbed into its mixed population.;;; They have penetrated the dense woods, crossed the prairies, cleared the forests, spanned the gigantic rivers, and planted themselves in all directions.;;; Scattered farms have grown into flourishing settlements, which again have increased into towns, have become centres of commerce and communication, have attached round them the industry and enterprise of new comers, have been brought near to other cities by the railroad, and nearer still by the telegraph, have combined their political influence, organized themselves into States, and by their admission into the Union have become component members of one of the richest, most prosperous, and most powerful nations in the world.;;; All this has happened within living memory.;;; Indeed, it is happening every day. It never stops.--Daily the population is augmented from without as well as from within.;;; Every day new havoc is made with the old trees.;;; Civilization presses farther and farther into the remote West, and fresh sources of wealth are opened up. There is no want of space.;;; If population presses too heavily in one place, a cheap and hasty migration to another rectifies the inconvenience.;;; Labor is welcome everywhere, and everywhere it is well repaid.;;; New states of society, creating new wants, are continually supplied by new developments of industry and new combinations of the inventive faculty.;;; Nor is all this enterprise confined to the States only.;;; There is not a port or a market in the world where the American merchant is not represented — American ships, American shoes, American clocks, American cotton and American leather are everywhere.";;; "Is there any definable limit to all this forth putting?;;; We know of none.;;; As America has grown, so she will continue to grow.--Let what will be in store for America, as long as she cherishes such hearty feeling toward this country as she has expressed by her attention to our popular young Prince, she may count to a very large extent upon the love and sympathy of the English people.;;; Among those hospitable friends we will for the present leave him, thankful for the welcome he has received, which can be exceeded only by one other — his welcome home."

TEXT: Oil in Western Virginia.;;; -- Astonishing Discoveries. --The Clark county (Va.) Journal contains a letter from Wirt Court-House, which gives an account of the traordinary discoveries of oil now being made in Western Virginia.;;; He gives some instances as follows@§@;;; Mr. Karns leased a piece of ground ( two acres,) from Mr. Rathbone, only six miles above mine, for twenty years, and at the depth of 150 feet reached a vein of oil which yields 15 barrels, of 40 gallons each, per day, worth, at the lowest price, 25 cents per gallon, and for which lease of two acres he ( Mr. K.) has been offered $70,000. This well has been in operation, without any decrease in quantity, for over three months. Mr. Rathbone, after he saw the success of Mr. Karns ' well, sank one himself below Karns', on the river, and I was there the evening he commenced pumping first.;;; He commenced at 6 o'clock P. M., and pumped until 6 o'clock A. M., just twelve hours, and filled a cistern containing 130 barrels of 40 gallons each — that is to say, 5,200 gallons of pure oil, worth 25 cents per gallon.;;; Rathbone 's well still continued to pour out the same quantity of oil up to last night, but that they had to stop pumping for want of cisterns and barrels; and that Mr. Karns told him that I had the best and surest prospect for oil next to Rathbone 's, on the river.;;; They have made another discovery in a hill or rather mountain on Hugh's River, a tributary of the Kanawha, and distant from here some twelve miles. It is the discovery of oil coal.;;; Mr. Mattingly, who owns it, told me himself (for we traveled together through this county a day, prospecting,) that the vein is 1,000 feet in thickness by actual measurement.;;; How wonderful are all these things, and yet how astonishing that they have not been discovered before; but you must remember that this is comparatively a new country, and that the early settlers were neither literary nor scientific men. Put this coal on a shovel and hold it over the fire until it becomes hot, and it all melts and turns to oil.;;; There is every prospect for a speedy improvement of this river, either by sluicing or damming, or slack water navigation, so as to introduce steamboats.;;; The fact is, they can not get their oil off fast enough by any other means, unless they build a railroad to unite with the Northwestern stem, a distance of twelve miles, and that is strongly talked of.

The stand bore above the speaker's desk the motto, "The Union, the Constitution, and the Enforcement of the Laws," and on either side the portraits of John Bell, of Tennessee, and Edward Everett, of Massachusetts.;;; The stand was appropriately dressed with flags, and lit with full jets of gas.

TEXT: Touching the money Nerve.;;; The face of Europe now presents, as it has presented for the last ten years, the most extraordinary military armaments.;;; The whole continent looks like one vast camp.;;; From three to four millions of armed men are supported by the various Governments, at an enormous expense.;;; In fact, such have been the vast amounts expended in preparing for war by all the continental nations with the exception of Prussia, that, according to the Liverpool Mercury, scarcely one of them is in a condition to face the additional expenditure of actual combat.;;; Not one of them, it is alleged, can raise more money by taxation, either direct or indirect, or can borrow money in large amounts except at ruinous interest in the open money market.;;; Austria, says the Mercury, cannot borrow at all; Russia can only obtain small sums, and that at a high rate of interest; France can borrow, but even in time of peace her three per cents are only worth 68, whilst those of England are worth 93.;;; England, in the opinion of the Mercury, could carry on war for a dozen years, at the rate of a hundred millions a year, without any danger of national bankruptcy, and it is the knowledge of this that is likely to save her from the evils of actual war. Nevertheless, she is expending seventy millions a year in time of peace to save her from the necessity of expending a hundred millions a year during a long period of war. This is an enormous sum for a peace establishment.;;; The Mercury confesses that it is only as a means of counteracting greater evils that it can be looked to without serious alarm, and that it may be reasonably doubted whether even the unrivalled wealth and industry of Great Britain would be able to bear it if it is to be permanent, while it has some "faint hope" that it will not be.-- Even this "faint hope" is founded not on any expectations that the Governments of the continent, whose enormous military and naval expenditures are the apology for British expenditure, will become more reasonable, but on the belief that the purses of their subjects will be emptied and their patience exhausted before those of Great Britain.;;; If this be the only hope of retrenchment in British expenditure, it will be necessary for British statesmen to husband their resources and nurse the various sources of revenue with great care and perseverance.;;; We should imagine that, under such circumstances, their relations with the United States would be well worth attending to. The vast manufacturing interests of Great Britain are dependent on the regular production of American staples, and it is about time that she should discourage the crusade within her borders against the labor by which those staples are produced.-- If she has no regard to any interests but her own, her own interests are reason enough, especially in view of the equally signs of the times, why she should give a quietus to Exeter Hall.

Y.) journals, in which he barbecues his Excellency alive, and does not spare the seasoning.;;; He remindshim that one of the great points urged by his friends in his canvass for Governor was his humble origin, and marvels that he should so soon have forgotten the rock whence he was hewn.;;; It is quite marvellous that an astute and hard-headed politician like Thurlow Weed should advise Gov. Morgan, in inviting his military staff to dine with the Prince of Wales, to exclude one of them on account of being a hotel keeper.;;; Yet the most cunning men in the world sometimes commit the greatest absurdities.;;; From the manner in which Horace Gresley floored Weed at Chicago, and this last superlative piece of nonsense, we suspect that Thurlow is getting in his dotage.;;; The Prince of Wales, on his visit to America, laid aside not only his title, but the strict etiquette of courts, and recognized all American citizens as standing in truth and reality on the platform of equality which they profess to occupy.;;; Moreover, the hotel keepers of the United States, in general, are as intelligent and every way gentlemanly a class of men as their guests, and in Albany, we should think, especially in the winter season, when the Legislature is in session, much more so. The New York Herald mentions, in connection with the case of Gov. Morgan and Gen. Mitchell, that when Lord Sydenham came over as Governor General, he was for some time the guest of a gentleman who kept a hotel in Toronto, and who did everything in his power to make him as comfortable as possible.;;; After the government house had been prepared for the Governor 's residence, he removed to it, and gave a dinner to the Mayor and Corporation, of which body the hotel keeper was a member.;;; The Governor General treated his fomer landlord with marked courtesy, and always asked him to the government house on festive occasions.;;; When it is remembered that the Governor General of Canada is the immediate representative of royalty, and always travels with regal surroundings, the conduct of Lord Sydenham comes out in rather bold relief against that of Gov. Morgan.

"Bleed her!" he cried.;;; No blood flowed from her arm. "Try the temple, doctor." Two drops stained her cap, but no more followed.;;; It was long before he would believe her dead.;;; He looked eagerly into her face, as if still expecting to see signs of returning life.-- Her hands and feet grew cold.;;; There could be no doubt then, and they prepared a table for laying her out. With a choking voice, the General said@§@;;; "Spread four blankets upon it. If she does come to, she will be so hard upon the table.";;; He sat all night long in the room by her side, with his face in his hands, "grieving." said Hannab, and occasionally looking into the face, and feeling the heart and pulse of the form so dear to him. Major Lewis, who had been immediately sent for, arrived just before daylight, and found him still there, nearly speechless and wholly inconsolable.;;; He sat in the room nearly all the next day, the picture of despair.;;; It was only with great difficulty that he was persuaded to take a little coffee.;;; "And this was the way." concluded Hannah, "that old misus died; and we always say that when we lost her we lost a misus and a mother, too; and more a mother than a misus.;;; And we say the same of old master; for he was more a father to us than a master, and many's the time we've wished him back again to help us out of our troubles.";;; The remains of Mrs. Jackson still lie in the corner of the Hermitage garden, next those of her husband, in a tomb prepared by him in these years for their reception.;;; It resembles in appearance an open summer house — a small white dome supported by pillars of white marble.;;; The table that covers the remains of Mrs. Jackson, read as follows@§@;;; "Here lie the remains of Mrs. Rachel Jackson, wife of President Jackson, who died the 22d of December, 1828, aged 61.;;; Her face was fair, her person pleasing, her temper amiable, her heart kind; she delighted in relieving the wants of her fellow-creatures, and cultivated that divine pleasure by the most liberal and unpretending methods; to the poor she was a benefactor; to the rich an example; to the wretched a comforter; to the prosperous an or nament; her piety went hand in hand with her benevolence, and she thanked her Creator for being permitted to do good.;;; A being so gentle and so virtuous, stander might wound but could not dishonor.;;; Even death, when he tore her from the arms of her husband, could but transport her to the bosom of her God."
