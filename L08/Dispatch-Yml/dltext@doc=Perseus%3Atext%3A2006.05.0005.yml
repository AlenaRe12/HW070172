TEXT: Execution of a Matricide.;;; -- Ezra Brainerd was hung at Three Rivers, C. W., on the 25th ult., for having murdered his mother some months since.;;; Since his conviction strong efforts have been made to have him pardoned on the ground of insanity, and the wretched doggerel which he has had published in a paper at Three Rivers would seem to indicate that be was far from being in his right mind.;;; A correspondent of the Montreal Gazette sketches the closing scene of his life.;;; He writes@§@;;; Shortly before 11 o'clock, a door leading to the convict's cell was closed, and the hangman proceeded to pinion his victim in the dimly-lighted dungeon, screened by the closed door from the looks of the people in the jail hall.;;; The constables who accompanied him state that while being pinioned Brainerd requested Sheriff Ogden to convey his body, after execution, to Melbourne, in the Townships, for burial, and that the twenty dollars in gold among his effects be appropriated for the purpose.;;; The Sheriff promised to comply with his request.;;; He also said to the hangman, "You are pinching me; you are beginning to murder me too soon." The convict pinioned, a rope was placed round his waist and the party, led by the Sheriff, proceeded up the two flights of stairs to the room leading to the drop.;;; Brainerd walked up the steps coolly and more unconcernedly than any of the spectators.;;; In the room the executioner took his hand off Brainerd 's neck and drew back the bolts of the door, outside which was the drop.;;; As he did so the crowd, which now amounted to about 2,000, and in which many women were to be seen, simultaneously exclaimed, " Le voila, le voila, " and swayed to and fro a few moments, eagerly looking up at Brainerd, who stood calmly gazing out into the rain.;;; The hangman stepped out on the drop and pulled down the noose.;;; Rev. Mr. Carron said, " Brainerd, humble yourself; repent; in ten minutes you will be no more, and facing your Creator." Words to this effect he repeated twice, but still Brainerd made no sign, and looked down at the crowd.;;; Precisely at 11, the preparations completed, Brainerd was led out on the drop, and the executioner placed the noose around his neck, having previously partly drawn the black cap down over his face and removed his hat, Brainerd saying that the wind would blow it off. He stood facing east, and exclaimed, in low tones, to the people outside, "Strangers, they are going to commit murder.;;; I am innocent.";;; He was deaf to all the entreaties of his spiritual advisers, and refused to be baptized before stepping upon the scaffold.;;; When the drop fell he appeared to suffer horribly; owing to the rain the rope had stiffened, and when cut did not close upon the victim's neck.;;; The fall, though six feet, did not appear sufficient to dislocate his neck.;;; Whirling rapidly around with the rope, his body was visibly agitated by his convulsive efforts to loosen his hands, every nerve seemed to writhe in agony, and after a short struggle, a horrid choked sound issued between his clenched teeth.;;; Gradually it ceased, and with it the upheavings of the chest and the agitation of the limbs.;;; A few gasps, and in a few moments Ezra Brainerd had expiated his crime.

Night was a relief compared to this dread, lurid fire in heaven — a fire which the clouds seemed to close in upon, and stifle out with difficulty --a fire which, like the paintings of the sunset before the Deluge, left always an ominous anger in the heavens, even when the night was far advanced, and the prairie clothed in a blue mist which rose over it like water.;;; It was such a sunset as moved the rural inhabitants of Dwight; such a sunset as even the "oldest inhabitant," who had been there some five years, had never seen before.

TEXT: The Press in England.;;; The Philadelphia North American publishes an extended notice from the foreign journals of the present state of the press in England, from which it appears that the English press has, within the last few years, undergone an extraordinary transformation.;;; The abolition of the tax on advertisements, followed by the repeal of the stamp duty, has exonerated it from all the heavy burdens (the duty on paper excepted) which weighed upon it. The number of newspapers has almost doubled, and their circulation has considerably increased. --It is no longer possible to ascertain the exact circulation of each journal.;;; The most contradictory statements are in vogue, even in the newspaper world itself, as well as in that of letters; so that the extent of the circulation of this or that journal is exaggerated or depreciated in such a manner as to put all calculation to flight.;;; Before the abolition of the stamp duty, it was easy to ascertain, almost to a copy, by means of the reports periodically published, what was the circulation of each newspaper; but now no newspapers are stamped except those destined to be sent by the post into the country.;;; The mass of the daily or weekly issue circulates free of stamp duty; so that the statements still published respecting the stamped editions of the newspaper will not give us the least idea of their real circulation.;;; One journal, for instance, may have a considerable circulation, and yet issue no stamped edition, its sale being limited to London; while another, with a far inferior circulation, sends at least one - third of its issue to be stamped in order to be sent to different parts of the United Kingdom.;;; We give the names of some of the principal daily and weekly journals of the metropolis of which the stamped editions are given in the latest report published by order of the House of Commons.;;; The return includes the number of copies of journals of the United Kingdom stamped between December, 1857, and June, 1859. We only quote the returns for one quarter, selecting those papers which are the best known.;;; Of the daily journals, the number of stamped copies issued between the 1st April and the 30th June, 1859, were@§@;;; the Times 816,058;;; the Morning Post 72,500;;; the Morning Herald 51,000;;; the Globe 50,000;;; the Daily News 49,789;;; the Morning Advertiser 20,000;;; the Morning Chronicle 15,000;;; the Standard 11,000;;; the Morning Star 9,000;;; of the weekly journals stamped during the same period, ( 1st April to 30th June, 1859, ) the numbers were@§@;;; the Illustrated London News 432,923;;; the News of the World 118,400;;; the Record 114,500;;; Bell 's Weekly Messenger 113,000;;; Bell 's Life in London 83,000;;; the Weekly Dispatch 75,000;;; the Weekly Times 62,000;;; the Saturday Review 53,000;;; the Athen æum 24,000;;; these numbers, which have reference to the stamped copies only, do not, it is said, give an accurate representation of the circulation of these different journals.;;; A more certain guide, it is observed, would be the best report published previously to the abolition of the stamp duty, which took place in 1855; for at that time every number of each journal had to be stamped, according to law. The returns of the first six months of 1855, show what was the exact issue of every newspaper in the United Kingdom.;;; Although the report embraces a period of six months, a very simple process of division will enable us to ascertain the daily issue of each journal.;;; According to this report, we find that the number of copies respectively issued by the daily journals, between the 31st of December, 1854, and the 1st of July, 1855, was as follows@§@;;; the Times 9,175,788;;; Morning Advertiser 1,034,618;;; Daily News 825,000;;; Morning Herald 554,000;;; Globe 540,000;;; Morning Post 455,000;;; Morning Chronicle 401,500;;; Weekly papers.;;; Illustrated London News 3,393,151;;; News of the World 2,885,000;;; Weekly Times 1,993,853;;; Weekly Dispatch 1,052,450;;; Bell 's Life in London 466,500;;; Bell 's Weekly Messenger 504,000;;; Record 205,000;;; Athenæum 81,000;;; Although these returns of the stamped issue give no perfectly reliable bases as to the circulation of this or that journal, yet it is the opinion of an intelligent and practical observer, who has taken considerable trouble to obtain results, that the following figures approximate the truth@§@ Daily circulation of the Times, about fifty thousand; Morning Advertiser, seven thousand; Daily News, from three thousand to three thousand five hundred; Morning Post, same; Morning Herald, about two thousand; Morning Chronicle, one thousand to fifteen hundred; Globe, from two thousand to twenty-five hundred; Sun, from fifteen hundred to two thousand.;;; With the exception of the Daily News, which has recently reduced its price to threepence, all these journals are sold at four pence each.--The circulation of the penny newspapers is much more considerable.;;; According to some, the Daily Telegraph issues daily 40,000 copies' or, according to others, 50,000 or 65,000; the Standard, from 25,000 to 30,000; the Star, from 20,000 to 30,000.;;; The Weekly Observer issues about 5,000 or 6,000 copies; Weekly Dispatch, about 40,000; Bell 's Life in London, about 28,000.;;; These Journals are sold at five cents. The Saturday Review, price sixpence, has a circulation of from 5,000 to 6,000; the Athenaeum, sold at four pence, nearly 12,000.;;; The London Illustrated News, which sells at five pence, has a circulation of nearly 100,000.;;; Of the weekly papers sold at two -pence, the Weekly Times (an entirely distinct paper from the London Times, ) has a circulation of nearly 85,000; the News of the World, of more than 100,000; Lloyd 's Weekly Newspaper and Reynolds ' Newspaper, of 160,000 to 180,000 copies.;;; Nevertheless, the public journals, it is remarked, form only a small portion of the periodical press, the family journals, published on Saturday, some of which have a circulation of 400,000 copies and the vast number of illustrated stories, novels and miscellanies, published on the same day and sold at low prices, completely throwing into the shade the circulation of the newspapers.;;; In England, it is added, every class and every opinion has its organ.;;; The sporting world are represented by Bell 's Life, The Sunday Times, The Era, The Field, The Sporting Times; and agriculture and commerce by the Mark Lone Express, the Farmers' Journal and the Gardeners' Chronicle. The various shades of opinion in the Anglican Church are represented by The Guardian, The English Churchman, the John Bull, The Recorder; the Dissenters have Non-Conformists, The Patriot and The Bulwark; the Methodist, the British Banner and the Wesleyan Times; the Roman Catholic Church, The Tablet and the Weekly Register. --The small towns have generally their weekly gazettes, while such a city as Edinburg has eighteen, and Glasgow thirty, besides their daily papers.;;; Politically, the London Times, "that Proteus of journalism, represents, properly speaking, only the fluctuations of public opinion, to the pressure of which it invariably yields; it owes its power, perhaps, solely to that unquenchable mobility which is its only role and its pervading spirit." The Morning Post, The Globe, The Observer, the Edinburgh Review, The Examiner, are mentioned as the principal organs of the Whig party; the Daily News, an independent liberal journal, represents more particularly the Russell coterie of that party.;;; The Tory organs are the Morning Herald, The Standard, The Press, Fraser 's Magazine, Blackwood 's Magazine, the Quarterly Review, and the Constitutional Press.;;; The Morning Chronicle represents the liberal conservative party; the Morning Star, the so-called liberal school of Manchester; the Daily Telegraph and the Westminster Review, radicalism; the Morning Advertiser is the organ of the ultra Protestant party.

Among the means which have been employed to this end, none have been attended with greater success than the establishment of boards composed of proper characters, charged with collecting and diffusing information enabled by premiums and small pecuniary aids to encourage and assist a spirit of discovery and improvement.;;; "This species of establishment contributes doubly to the increase of improvement, by stimulating enterprise and experiment, and by drawing to a common centre the results everywhere of individual skill and observation, and spreading them thence over the whole nation.;;; Experience accordingly has shown that they are very cheap instruments of immense national benefits.";;; Whilst the laws of Congress for 1789 to 1836 are overflowing with provisions for the protection of manufactures; whilst from 1816 to this time, we have expended for repairs, increase and support of the navy, which is established for the protection of commerce, nearly one hundred and fifty millions of dollars, there has never been one dollar appropriated for the direct encouragement of agriculture, which is the business of nine - tenths of the American people.

To which the General replied, "you must think me very simple to have come here without the Emperor 's permission.;;; It was I who settled the campaign with him at Chamber, and his last recommendation was that if the matter was to be done let it be done quickly." In a letter which Victor Emanuel wrote a short time since to the King of Naples at Gaeta, he said, speaking of Garibaldi, "try to beat him; try to catch him, and, above all, hang him!" The correspondent is assured that the King of Naples repeated these words to a great personage now or lately at Gaeta.;;; With all this, Victor Emanuel and Garibaldi will probably be the best friends in the world when they meet; but the " Re Galantuomo " occasionally passes through phases of temper not quite in keeping with his designation.

TEXT: A Card;;; --The readers of the Richmond Enquirer probably observed, in its issue of Thursday last, an article headed " Judge R. H. Field, of Culpeper." While the character of my father is too well established among those who know him to be affected by such an article, respect for public sentiment requires it to be noticed.;;; Having read in the Enquirer an editorial advocating resistance and disunion upon the election of Mr. Lincoln, and believing the step to be premature and injudicious, Judge Field wished to counteract, as far as in his power, the influence of opinions leading to this result, and was thus induced to write his letter to the Observer. The letter sustained the policy of abiding the election of Mr. Lincoln only "so long as he supports the Constitution of the United States and executes in good faith the laws of the Union." Whatever may have been the form and tone of the letter, the purpose was an honest one, and one which better men than the pensioned editor of the Richmond Enquirer will approve aid endorse.;;; It is by no means a contemptible party who are in favor of secession only when our rights have in reality been assailed, and who are opposed to permitting the too hasty action of heated partizans and the selfish plotting of unprincipled men to precipitate the Southern States into Disunion, with its attendant destruction of life and property — with every horror of servile and civil war. The charge that, in writing his letter, Judge Field was actuated by desire of more elevated position under the Lincoln Administration, is a falsehood as slanderous as untrue. Were Judge Field a young man, just entering with the ambition and energy of early manhood the theatre of public life, the charge might be plausible; against a man who has almost reached the allotted age of three score years and ten, it is more absurd than unjust.

HEADER: The Big Bear of San Joaquin.
TEXT: The Big Bear of San Joaquin.;;; --Most of our readers have read the amusing story of the "Big Bear of Arkansas." An old bear-hunter tells the story of his following him for many months without success, and that he finally concluded he was a creation of the evil one, to bewilder him and damage his soul.;;; A similar brute to the one described in the tale has infested the San Joaquin valley, between the San Joaquin river and the coast range, for at least three years. He was a grizzly of enormous size, but of great speed.;;; Parties of farmers and cattle-raisers turned out again and again to pursue him, but when they thought they surely had him, the beast suddenly disappeared, as if he had suck into the ground.;;; Bullets appeared to have no effect upon him. He has been a terror to everything on four legs in that district, and many a fat bullock has made a meal for him. The farmers became almost as superstitious as the old hunter, and some almost believed, like him, that Old Nick protected their scourge.;;; A few days ago, however, the illusion was dispelled.;;; Dr. Samuel Mitchell and some other gentlemen got upon the track of the long-dreaded depredator about fifty miles from this city, near the San Joaquin, and succeeded in killing him. He was worn down almost to a skeleton, and the captors, we presume, did not have as much difficulty with him as if he was in full health and strength.;;; They found eighteen balls in their prize.;;; The residents of the valley are fortunate in being finally rid of him.-- San Joaquin (Cal.) Republican.

A little girl, a sister of the damsel, jumped up, and looking archly at her sister, said, in a tone loud enough for every one to hear, "Yes, sir, our Becky does."
